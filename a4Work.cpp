if (a<b); //need to write an operator "operator<()" that will do this for us

//for declaring the vector:

vect V(2);//tells us how long the array should be
v[0] = 1;  //goes into an array for storage
v[1] = 2; //
	



how to do a dynamically declared array:

cin >> N;
short *p;
p = new short[100];//this will make an array at location p.
