4	Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having
5	little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
6	shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
7	the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating
8	the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
9	whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find
10	myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
11	the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get
12	such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
13	prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
14	knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea
15	as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
16	philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
17	take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew
18	it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
19	nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
