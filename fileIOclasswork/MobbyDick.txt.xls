4	70	21	Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having
5	72	22	little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
6	71	24	shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
7	70	21	the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating
8	69	21	the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
9	67	19	whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find
10	70	23	myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
11	70	22	the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get
12	70	21	such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
13	71	21	prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
14	70	21	knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea
15	67	19	as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
16	68	21	philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
17	71	19	take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew
18	68	21	it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
19	51	16	nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

21	65	20	There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
22	66	20	wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with
23	69	19	her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
24	70	19	downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
25	72	23	cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
26	41	12	Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

28	71	23	Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
29	69	18	Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What
30	68	21	do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
31	68	24	thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
32	65	23	leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some
33	69	20	looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
34	69	20	rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these
35	67	19	are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied to
36	69	19	counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are
37	41	12	the green fields gone? What do they here?
38	0	0	
39	67	19	But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
40	70	19	seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
41	68	21	extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
42	69	20	warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water
43	71	19	as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand--miles of
44	70	20	them--leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
45	67	20	and avenues--north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite.
46	72	23	Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
47	33	8	those ships attract them thither?
48	0	0	
49	71	23	Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
50	67	23	almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
51	66	22	dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic
52	66	19	in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
53	71	20	reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
54	67	22	infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
55	65	20	Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this
56	69	23	experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
57	71	23	professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
58	5	2	ever.

60	71	24	But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
61	72	22	quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
62	70	20	the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,
63	72	22	each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
64	70	21	here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
65	64	21	cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a
66	68	21	mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
67	68	20	hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though
68	69	20	this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's
69	70	22	head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the
70	71	23	magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores
71	69	24	on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the
72	67	20	one charm wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there! Were
73	71	25	Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to
74	71	23	see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two
75	72	21	handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly
76	71	22	needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why
77	72	21	is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at
78	70	23	some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a
79	70	21	passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first
80	70	19	told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the
81	69	21	old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate
82	71	21	deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning.
83	68	21	And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because
84	69	21	he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,
85	70	23	plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see
86	71	23	in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of
87	36	10	life; and this is the key to it all.
88	0	0	
89	71	23	Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
90	72	22	to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,
91	71	25	I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.
92	68	23	For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is
93	66	21	but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get
94	63	18	sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjoy
95	68	20	themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger;
96	62	21	nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
97	71	24	Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction
98	68	21	of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all
99	68	23	honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
100	67	22	whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
101	70	19	without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
102	71	22	And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory
103	68	21	in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow,
104	65	22	I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously
105	68	21	buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
106	68	21	will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
107	64	20	fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
108	69	24	Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
109	66	23	mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.
110	0	0	
111	69	22	No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
112	67	20	plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
113	68	21	True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
114	65	18	spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort
115	64	22	of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honour,
116	70	22	particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
117	66	19	Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,
118	69	23	if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
119	67	18	lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand
120	65	25	in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
121	71	25	schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
122	72	23	the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in
123	5	2	time.
124	0	0	
125	71	23	What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
126	70	20	and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
127	70	21	I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
128	62	17	Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
129	71	20	respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't
130	67	19	a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may
131	69	22	order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
132	68	20	satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
133	66	21	one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical
134	69	21	or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
135	72	20	passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and
136	11	3	be content.
137	0	0	
138	67	26	Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
139	68	20	paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
140	71	19	penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must
141	64	19	pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying
142	67	20	and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
143	67	22	infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But BEING
144	70	20	PAID,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man
145	69	23	receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
146	72	23	believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account
147	70	23	can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves
148	13	5	to perdition!
149	0	0	
150	65	24	Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
151	68	21	exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,
152	66	18	head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,
153	69	22	if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
154	69	21	Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
155	70	20	the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not
156	69	21	so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
157	66	19	other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.
158	68	22	But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
159	69	22	merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
160	67	22	voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the
161	68	20	constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me
162	71	23	in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And,
163	68	18	doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
164	72	23	programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as
165	71	25	a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.
166	71	20	I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:
167	0	0	
168	0	0	
169	66	20	"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
170	0	0	
171	31	10	"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
172	0	0	
173	32	9	"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."
174	0	0	
175	0	0	
176	70	19	Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
177	72	19	Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
178	68	19	were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and
179	65	19	easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though
180	66	16	I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the
181	70	21	circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives
182	70	23	which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
183	71	23	me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the
184	69	23	delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
185	28	8	and discriminating judgment.
186	0	0	
187	64	22	Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
188	69	21	whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
189	68	20	curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
190	70	21	bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all
191	72	22	the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped
192	69	16	to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not
193	72	23	have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting
194	66	20	itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on
195	69	24	barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a
196	70	20	horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it
197	69	19	is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place
198	14	5	one lodges in.
199	0	0	
200	68	19	By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
201	65	18	great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
202	69	21	conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
203	71	19	my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
204	59	18	all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.

210	0	0	
211	72	19	I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
212	68	20	and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of
213	71	21	old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in
214	70	22	December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet
215	72	22	for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place
216	39	11	would offer, till the following Monday.
217	0	0	
218	71	22	As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
219	71	21	this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
220	68	21	be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was
221	71	24	made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a
222	70	24	fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
223	70	20	old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has
224	71	23	of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
225	71	20	in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket
226	71	21	was her great original--the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the
227	69	21	first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket
228	72	23	did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to
229	72	22	give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that
230	68	19	first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
231	68	19	cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to
232	72	21	discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?
233	0	0	
234	70	20	Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
235	68	21	in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a
236	70	23	matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a
237	70	19	very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
238	70	22	and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had
239	67	19	sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So,
240	71	23	wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of
241	71	20	a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
242	70	20	north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you
243	72	23	may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire
244	39	12	the price, and don't be too particular.
245	0	0	
246	67	17	With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of "The
247	71	22	Crossed Harpoons"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further
248	72	17	on, from the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish Inn," there came such
249	72	21	fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from
250	72	24	before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches
251	72	19	thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck
252	70	21	my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless
253	66	21	service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too
254	69	22	expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the
255	70	20	broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
256	68	21	within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away
257	70	22	from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I
258	72	19	went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for
259	63	19	there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
260	0	0	
261	69	18	Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
262	69	23	and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At
263	68	19	this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
264	71	19	the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light
265	72	22	proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly
266	69	23	open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the
267	66	18	public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an
268	71	18	ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost
269	71	20	choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But "The
270	70	16	Crossed Harpoons," and "The Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the
271	72	22	sign of "The Trap." However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
272	53	18	within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.
273	0	0	
274	71	21	It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
275	67	20	faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel
276	70	22	of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
277	72	20	preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and
278	71	22	wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,
279	49	13	Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'
280	0	0	
281	72	19	Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,
282	71	22	and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging
283	70	22	sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing
284	68	17	a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath--"The
285	28	8	Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."
286	0	0	
287	71	23	Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought
288	69	21	I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this
289	69	21	Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
290	72	25	the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little
291	68	24	wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from
292	64	17	the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
293	70	19	poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
294	52	15	spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
295	0	0	
296	71	26	It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
297	69	21	as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
298	72	23	where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever
299	69	22	it did about poor Paul's tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a
300	68	19	mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob
301	69	21	quietly toasting for bed. "In judging of that tempestuous wind called
302	71	19	Euroclydon," says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy
303	71	24	extant--"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at
304	72	21	it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether
305	71	19	thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both
306	70	20	sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier." True enough,
307	70	19	thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou
308	69	21	reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is
309	70	18	the house. What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies
310	69	20	though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it's too late
311	69	23	to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone
312	70	23	is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus
313	69	20	there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and
314	71	18	shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears
315	68	18	with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not
316	71	24	keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his
317	69	20	red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What
318	71	17	a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them
319	72	25	talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give
320	59	16	me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
321	0	0	
322	70	17	But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
323	68	19	to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra
324	68	19	than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
325	70	22	line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in
326	29	9	order to keep out this frost?
327	0	0	
328	71	22	Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
329	68	21	door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
330	69	24	moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a
331	70	23	Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
332	62	18	temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

334	72	22	But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
335	72	21	plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,
336	51	15	and see what sort of a place this "Spouter" may be.

340	27	7	CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
341	0	0	
342	0	0	
343	68	23	Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
344	68	19	low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
345	71	21	the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
346	70	22	oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
347	67	19	unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
348	69	22	study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of
349	71	22	the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
350	71	21	purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
351	70	24	you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
352	70	22	England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint
353	67	21	of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
354	69	19	especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
355	68	22	entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however
356	42	12	wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.
357	0	0	
358	72	21	But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
359	72	22	black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
360	69	22	blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,
361	72	21	soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
362	63	23	Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable
363	70	24	sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily
364	68	22	took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting
365	71	24	meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you
366	68	19	through.--It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It's the unnatural
367	66	19	combat of the four primal elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a
368	70	22	Hyperborean winter scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream
369	69	23	of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous
370	71	20	something in the picture's midst. THAT once found out, and all the rest
371	72	24	were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
372	39	12	fish? even the great leviathan himself?
373	0	0	
374	67	18	In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
375	72	22	partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom
376	71	23	I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a
377	71	22	great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
378	70	23	dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to
379	71	21	spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
380	26	8	upon the three mast-heads.
381	0	0	
382	67	20	The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
383	63	17	array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with
384	72	20	glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of
385	72	22	human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round
386	70	20	like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You
387	71	23	shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage
388	71	22	could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying
389	70	20	implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons
390	71	22	all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long
391	72	21	lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen
392	66	22	whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a
393	69	18	corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,
394	72	24	years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered
395	70	22	nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a
396	69	19	man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the
397	5	1	hump.
398	0	0	
399	65	15	Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut
400	69	20	through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
401	70	23	fireplaces all round--you enter the public room. A still duskier place
402	67	19	is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
403	69	19	planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's
404	71	19	cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
405	70	22	old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
406	66	19	table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
407	67	18	gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks. Projecting from the
408	68	20	further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude
409	69	18	attempt at a right whale's head. Be that how it may, there stands the
410	72	21	vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive
411	71	20	beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
412	69	19	bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another
413	69	19	cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little
414	64	18	withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors
415	20	7	deliriums and death.

417	66	22	Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though
418	68	20	true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses
419	70	23	deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
420	71	20	rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. Fill to
421	71	19	THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS a penny more; and so
422	72	20	on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for
423	11	3	a shilling.

425	71	26	Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about
426	69	20	a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER. I
427	72	22	sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a
428	72	24	room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied.
429	69	22	"But avast," he added, tapping his forehead, "you haint no objections
430	66	23	to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye? I s'pose you are goin'
431	59	16	a-whalin', so you'd better get used to that sort of thing."
432	0	0	
433	69	21	I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
434	65	21	ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and
435	67	18	that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
436	66	21	harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
437	70	21	further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with
438	37	9	the half of any decent man's blanket.
439	0	0	
440	64	18	"I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?--you want supper?
441	29	7	Supper'll be ready directly."
442	0	0	
443	71	22	I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
444	71	21	Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
445	70	21	his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
446	71	19	between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but
447	39	11	he didn't make much headway, I thought.
448	0	0	
449	63	23	At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
450	68	21	adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord
451	71	20	said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each
452	69	22	in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and
453	71	20	hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But
454	70	21	the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,
455	70	20	but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in
456	72	22	a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
457	7	2	manner.
458	0	0	
459	65	18	"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead
460	11	3	sartainty."
461	0	0	
462	58	17	"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"
463	0	0	
464	72	23	"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the harpooneer
465	71	21	is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don't--he eats
466	43	12	nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."
467	0	0	
468	68	21	"The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?"
469	0	0	
470	43	12	"He'll be here afore long," was the answer.
471	0	0	
472	65	21	I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this "dark
473	70	23	complexioned" harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
474	70	21	turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
475	17	6	bed before I did.
476	0	0	
477	69	18	Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
478	72	20	what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening
479	15	6	as a looker on.
480	0	0	
481	70	21	Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
482	68	18	cried, "That's the Grampus's crew. I seed her reported in the offing
483	71	19	this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now
484	45	13	we'll have the latest news from the Feegees."
485	0	0	
486	72	21	A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
487	70	22	and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy
488	68	19	watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all
489	72	21	bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an
490	70	21	eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat,
491	69	18	and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they
492	70	19	made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled
493	70	23	little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all
494	65	21	round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah
495	71	22	mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
496	71	21	sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how
497	69	19	long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the
498	30	11	weather side of an ice-island.
499	0	0	
500	67	24	The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
501	72	20	with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering
502	26	9	about most obstreperously.
503	0	0	
504	69	22	I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
505	72	23	he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
506	69	23	sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise
507	67	20	as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods
508	65	21	had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a
509	68	21	sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will
510	69	23	here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet
511	70	21	in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have
512	69	18	seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,
513	66	18	making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep
514	72	24	shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give
515	67	22	him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner,
516	65	20	and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall
517	69	24	mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry
518	66	20	of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away
519	69	22	unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the
520	67	20	sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and
521	72	25	being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised
522	72	19	a cry of "Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and darted out of
523	28	10	the house in pursuit of him.
524	0	0	
525	58	19	It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost
526	71	25	supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself
527	72	23	upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance
528	14	5	of the seamen.
529	0	0	
530	68	22	No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
531	67	18	rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how it is, but
532	70	23	people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to
533	65	18	sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange
534	71	23	town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely
535	67	20	multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should
536	69	22	sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep
537	67	21	two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they
538	71	23	all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
539	65	19	cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
540	0	0	
541	67	25	The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
542	65	20	thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
543	71	23	harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
544	70	21	the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
545	66	21	Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be
546	68	21	home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
547	66	19	midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
548	0	0	
549	70	20	"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't sleep
550	35	7	with him. I'll try the bench here."
551	0	0	
552	65	20	"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
553	71	20	mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the knots and
554	68	19	notches. "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane
555	71	21	there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough." So saying
556	71	19	he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
557	71	19	the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
558	63	16	like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
559	69	21	plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was
560	71	21	near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--the
561	70	20	bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing
562	71	22	in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
563	69	19	shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
564	68	21	the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
565	12	2	brown study.
566	0	0	
567	69	23	I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
568	67	20	short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
569	68	21	narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
570	67	19	than the planed one--so there was no yoking them. I then placed the
571	67	18	first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
572	71	21	leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I
573	72	23	soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under
574	72	20	the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially
575	69	20	as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,
576	70	22	and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate
577	60	16	vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
578	0	0	
579	70	20	The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal
580	70	20	a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
581	70	22	wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
582	68	18	second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
583	69	23	morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
584	50	12	standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
585	0	0	
586	72	23	Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending
587	70	21	a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think
588	69	22	that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against
589	72	21	this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping
590	69	21	in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may
591	59	17	become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.
592	0	0	
593	71	19	But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
594	47	14	and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
595	0	0	
596	72	20	"Landlord!" said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such
597	49	14	late hours?" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.
598	0	0	
599	64	19	The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to
600	66	18	be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. "No," he
601	68	21	answered, "generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to
602	72	18	rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out
603	69	22	a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late,
604	40	10	unless, may be, he can't sell his head."
605	0	0	
606	68	18	"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
607	70	22	are telling me?" getting into a towering rage. "Do you pretend to say,
608	72	22	landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday
609	72	19	night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?"
610	0	0	
611	69	17	"That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't
612	40	11	sell it here, the market's overstocked."
613	0	0	
614	23	6	"With what?" shouted I.
615	0	0	
616	65	19	"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"
617	0	0	
618	69	20	"I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better
619	46	11	stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."
620	0	0	
621	66	18	"May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I
622	69	24	rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a
623	21	6	slanderin' his head."
624	0	0	
625	72	22	"I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at this
626	40	13	unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.
627	0	0	
628	30	9	"It's broke a'ready," said he.
629	0	0	
630	38	12	"Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"

632	64	17	"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."
633	0	0	
634	61	18	"Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
635	68	17	snow-storm--"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one
636	68	24	another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a
637	69	21	bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
638	66	24	belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I
639	68	19	have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
640	68	24	exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
641	70	20	towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion,
642	66	21	landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
643	70	22	degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
644	71	21	harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the
645	71	20	night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay
646	66	21	that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good
647	72	25	evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping
648	70	19	with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying
649	72	23	to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to
650	24	9	a criminal prosecution."
651	0	0	
652	71	16	"Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a purty long
653	72	20	sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,
654	69	24	this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from
655	69	22	the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads
656	72	21	(great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one
657	72	19	he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not
658	69	21	do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to
659	69	18	churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was
660	69	20	goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the
661	31	10	airth like a string of inions."
662	0	0	
663	71	23	This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
664	67	20	that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at
665	68	24	the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
666	70	21	Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
667	48	16	business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
668	0	0	
669	63	20	"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."
670	0	0	
671	70	19	"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder. "But come, it's getting dreadful
672	67	20	late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed; Sal and me
673	71	19	slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room
674	70	17	for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why,
675	69	22	afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the
676	67	21	foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
677	70	21	somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
678	68	21	Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a
679	71	19	glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
680	71	24	me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a
681	72	21	clock in the corner, he exclaimed "I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that
682	71	23	harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO
683	21	6	come; WON'T ye come?"
684	0	0	
685	71	21	I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
686	70	22	ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
687	72	26	with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
688	17	6	to sleep abreast.
689	0	0	
690	71	19	"There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
691	67	19	that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; "there, make
692	68	20	yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye." I turned round from
693	39	13	eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
694	0	0	
695	72	23	Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the
696	70	19	most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced
697	68	22	round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see
698	69	22	no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four
699	70	22	walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of
700	69	19	things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed
701	71	22	up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,
702	71	24	containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.
703	71	23	Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf
704	72	22	over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
705	0	0	
706	69	19	But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
707	72	20	light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive
708	66	22	at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to
709	65	20	nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little
710	66	21	tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
711	68	21	Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,
712	71	25	as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible
713	67	23	that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
714	72	20	streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try
715	69	20	it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and
716	72	22	thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer
717	69	22	had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass
718	71	20	stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore
719	71	19	myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
720	0	0	
721	68	20	I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
722	71	23	head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
723	71	20	the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
724	69	19	the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought
725	71	20	a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,
726	69	21	half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about
727	68	20	the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very
728	72	24	late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and
729	72	19	then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the
730	15	6	care of heaven.
731	0	0	
732	68	16	Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
733	72	24	there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep
734	69	19	for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty
735	71	22	nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy
736	70	22	footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room
737	20	6	from under the door.
738	0	0	
739	65	19	Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
740	71	19	head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
741	67	19	till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
742	69	22	Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
743	72	21	looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
744	69	20	floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords
745	66	22	of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all
746	69	24	eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while
747	68	20	employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he
748	70	20	turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of
749	69	20	a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large
750	70	20	blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible
751	68	19	bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,
752	69	19	just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face
753	58	15	so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be
754	70	19	sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were
755	71	20	stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;
756	72	22	but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of
757	71	22	a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been
758	72	23	tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his
759	72	22	distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it,
760	71	21	thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any
761	70	19	sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that
762	72	22	part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the
763	72	24	squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of
764	70	21	tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man
765	72	24	into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;
766	71	22	and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the
767	72	21	skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,
768	67	22	this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty
769	72	20	having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled
770	72	22	out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing
771	70	20	these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New
772	71	20	Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag.
773	71	22	He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out
774	71	22	with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at
775	69	19	least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His
776	70	20	bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.
777	71	22	Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted
778	46	16	out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
779	0	0	
780	70	21	Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but
781	65	19	it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of
782	68	20	this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
783	68	21	Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and
784	72	23	confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him
785	66	19	as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
786	65	19	the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not
787	70	21	game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
788	43	14	concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
789	0	0	
790	70	22	Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
791	72	21	his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered
792	71	22	with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same
793	69	21	dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just
794	67	17	escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very
795	68	20	legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up
796	70	20	the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some
797	68	25	abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South
798	71	21	Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it.
799	71	20	A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might
800	53	17	take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!
801	0	0	
802	67	21	But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
803	72	21	something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that
804	69	22	he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or
805	71	21	dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the
806	68	22	pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with
807	70	20	a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo
808	67	19	baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that
809	72	22	this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But
810	71	22	seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal
811	69	22	like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden
812	69	22	idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the
813	67	20	empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this
814	67	21	little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The
815	66	18	chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I
816	71	23	thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel
817	19	6	for his Congo idol.
818	0	0	
819	69	20	I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
820	68	22	ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes
821	70	23	about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
822	68	21	them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
823	70	18	top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into
824	72	21	a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,
825	69	20	and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be
826	71	20	scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;
827	71	23	then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of
828	71	20	it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such
829	67	18	dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange
830	66	20	antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the
831	69	23	devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some
832	68	20	pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the
833	71	23	most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol
834	67	23	up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
835	61	19	carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
836	0	0	
837	63	21	All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and
838	68	19	seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
839	69	21	operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
840	71	20	now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which
841	25	8	I had so long been bound.
842	0	0	
843	70	22	But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
844	72	23	Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an
845	72	18	instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
846	70	21	he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light
847	69	21	was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,
848	72	20	sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving
849	51	16	a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
850	0	0	
851	65	19	Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
852	69	20	against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
853	70	21	be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his
854	71	22	guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
855	8	3	meaning.
856	0	0	
857	72	22	"Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e."
858	68	22	And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
859	5	1	dark.
860	0	0	
861	70	17	"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I. "Landlord! Watch!
862	25	7	Coffin! Angels! save me!"
863	0	0	
864	71	23	"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled the
865	69	21	cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
866	69	22	hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
867	70	20	But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
868	50	14	in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
869	0	0	
870	71	23	"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here wouldn't
871	26	9	harm a hair of your head."
872	0	0	
873	70	17	"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that that
874	36	13	infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"
875	0	0	
876	67	17	"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads
877	67	23	around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
878	68	26	here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?"
879	0	0	
880	66	21	"Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
881	18	5	sitting up in bed.
882	0	0	
883	65	21	"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
884	72	21	throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil
885	70	22	but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment.
886	66	21	For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking
887	69	21	cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to
888	72	20	myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason
889	68	23	to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober
890	34	10	cannibal than a drunken Christian.
891	0	0	
892	70	19	"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
893	68	18	whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will
894	72	18	turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.
895	42	14	It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured."
896	0	0	
897	68	24	This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
898	67	23	motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to
899	33	9	say--"I won't touch a leg of ye."
900	0	0	
901	45	12	"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."

907	27	8	CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
908	0	0	
909	0	0	
910	70	22	Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown
911	66	22	over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost
912	70	21	thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of
913	68	21	odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
914	68	23	tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure,
915	67	22	no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to
916	69	21	his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
917	71	24	sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I
918	72	20	say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.
919	69	20	Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could
920	71	19	hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and
921	70	19	it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that
922	24	9	Queequeg was hugging me.
923	0	0	
924	68	19	My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
925	70	21	child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
926	67	22	whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.
927	71	22	The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other--I
928	67	18	think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little
929	70	21	sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
930	66	17	was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my
931	69	19	mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
932	70	19	bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
933	69	21	the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But
934	70	20	there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the
935	71	19	third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
936	46	13	and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
937	0	0	
938	70	23	I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
939	65	23	before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the
940	67	17	small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the
941	68	20	sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the
942	69	22	streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse
943	65	16	and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
944	68	17	stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself
945	68	25	at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
946	72	23	slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie
947	70	20	abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most
948	66	20	conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For
949	72	26	several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I
950	71	24	have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At
951	71	22	last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly
952	72	22	waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before
953	72	20	sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock
954	69	18	running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was
955	71	22	to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung
956	65	22	over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form
957	67	18	or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my
958	70	22	bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with
959	72	19	the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking
960	70	20	that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be
961	70	20	broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;
962	68	19	but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for
963	65	17	days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding
964	71	19	attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle
965	15	3	myself with it.
966	0	0	
967	63	20	Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
968	69	22	supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
969	66	24	those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
970	70	16	arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night's events soberly
971	68	22	recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to
972	71	22	the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm--unlock his
973	70	18	bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
974	70	22	as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
975	70	21	him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over,
976	68	20	my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a
977	70	20	slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
978	68	21	sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A
979	68	20	pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the
980	69	23	broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! "Queequeg!--in the name of
981	68	18	goodness, Queequeg, wake!" At length, by dint of much wriggling, and
982	64	22	loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
983	71	23	hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
984	70	17	extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself
985	72	21	all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,
986	67	20	stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he
987	64	21	did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
988	70	23	consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
989	70	24	him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
990	69	22	now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at
991	70	21	last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
992	69	23	and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon
993	70	19	the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
994	65	19	if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress
995	70	21	afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,
996	68	21	under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
997	66	21	truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what
998	70	23	you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this
999	69	25	particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much
1000	65	22	civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
1001	71	20	staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for
1002	70	20	the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,
1003	70	24	a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well
1004	24	8	worth unusual regarding.
1005	0	0	
1006	72	20	He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,
1007	70	16	by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots.
1008	65	18	What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next
1009	72	19	movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;
1010	68	18	when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was
1011	71	20	hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever
1012	63	20	heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
1013	65	25	boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
1014	70	22	stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized
1015	69	19	to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His
1016	71	24	education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not
1017	71	23	been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled
1018	71	20	himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,
1019	70	21	he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At
1020	72	19	last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his
1021	63	20	eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
1022	66	20	being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
1023	69	21	ones--probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented
1024	49	13	him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.
1025	0	0	
1026	68	20	Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
1027	67	23	street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
1028	69	24	into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
1029	71	24	Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;
1030	67	23	I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,
1031	67	22	and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He
1032	65	19	complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the
1033	66	22	morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to
1034	69	20	my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
1035	69	18	chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a
1036	71	22	piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water
1037	69	21	and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept
1038	72	20	his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner,
1039	71	21	slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little
1040	67	19	on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,
1041	70	21	begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks
1042	66	21	I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.
1043	71	23	Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of
1044	72	23	what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp
1045	40	11	the long straight edges are always kept.
1046	0	0	
1047	71	23	The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
1048	71	20	the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
1049	31	10	harpoon like a marshal's baton.

1056	70	22	I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
1057	69	19	grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
1058	70	19	though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
1059	10	3	bedfellow.
1060	0	0	
1061	69	22	However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
1062	63	17	good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any one man, in his own
1063	70	20	proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be
1064	71	18	backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
1065	72	21	that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him,
1066	61	18	be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.
1067	0	0	
1068	70	20	The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
1069	71	22	night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
1070	72	20	nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and
1071	70	22	sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers,
1072	67	16	and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an
1073	66	16	unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
1074	0	0	
1075	69	21	You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
1076	67	22	young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and
1077	67	20	would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days
1078	67	20	landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades
1079	62	19	lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the
1080	72	19	complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached
1081	71	22	withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show
1082	72	25	a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the
1083	71	20	Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates,
1084	13	4	zone by zone.

1086	72	19	"Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went

1089	71	23	They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
1090	72	20	in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard,
1091	71	19	the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all
1092	70	20	men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the
1093	69	20	mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or
1094	71	20	the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart
1095	71	20	of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances--this kind of
1096	71	22	travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
1097	65	15	polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
1098	9	3	anywhere.
1099	0	0	
1100	67	22	These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
1101	71	24	after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some
1102	65	20	good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every
1103	69	22	man maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
1104	71	22	embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
1105	71	21	slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas--entire
1106	71	20	strangers to them--and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here
1107	69	21	they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling, all of
1108	72	22	kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
1109	72	24	had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains.
1110	67	22	A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!
1111	0	0	
1112	71	24	But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head of
1113	72	24	the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot
1114	72	22	say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially
1115	72	22	justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it
1116	72	23	there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent
1117	69	19	jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But
1118	71	19	THAT was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that in
1119	70	22	most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
1120	0	0	
1121	71	26	We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he eschewed
1122	72	24	coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,
1123	68	21	done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the
1124	69	20	rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting
1125	71	22	there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I
1126	25	8	sallied out for a stroll.

1133	69	22	If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
1134	67	27	an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
1135	68	20	civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
1136	51	12	daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
1137	0	0	
1138	62	19	In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
1139	71	23	frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
1140	68	21	parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners
1141	65	20	will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not
1142	71	21	unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
1143	70	22	Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water
1144	72	23	Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors;
1145	70	19	but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners;
1146	72	20	savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It
1147	23	7	makes a stranger stare.
1148	0	0	
1149	71	25	But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
1150	69	18	and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
1151	70	22	which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
1152	70	24	more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
1153	70	20	scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
1154	68	17	and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
1155	72	20	fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch
1156	69	22	the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they
1157	67	20	came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look
1158	70	20	there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and
1159	70	22	swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here
1160	55	19	comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.

1162	65	19	No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a
1163	69	16	downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
1164	70	19	two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
1165	70	23	country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
1166	65	22	reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the
1167	67	22	comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his
1168	67	20	sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his
1169	72	18	canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps
1170	69	17	in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and
1171	36	9	all, down the throat of the tempest.

1173	72	20	But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
1174	71	20	bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer
1175	69	19	place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this
1176	71	23	day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador.
1177	68	20	As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they
1178	66	20	look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live
1179	70	22	in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like
1180	67	19	Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with
1181	71	17	milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in
1182	71	25	spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like
1183	72	21	houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came
1184	61	17	they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?

1186	66	22	Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
1187	72	24	mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses
1188	71	22	and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
1189	70	21	One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom
1190	56	18	of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?

1192	66	18	In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
1193	69	24	daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
1194	69	20	You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,
1195	70	22	they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
1196	41	11	burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.

1198	67	20	In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long
1199	72	25	avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and
1200	71	21	bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their
1201	69	21	tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;
1202	72	20	which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces
1203	72	23	of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final
1204	4	1	day.

1206	70	20	And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
1207	70	23	roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
1208	69	21	is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that
1209	71	21	bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young
1210	70	20	girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
1211	71	23	shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of
1212	20	6	the Puritanic sands.

1219	70	20	In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few are

1223	69	20	Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
1224	70	17	special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
1225	71	16	sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
1226	65	18	bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I
1227	71	23	found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors' wives and
1228	70	20	widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
1229	72	21	of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from
1230	71	24	the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The
1231	71	21	chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and
1232	72	20	women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders,
1233	66	21	masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran
1234	62	19	something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:--

1250	72	20	Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself
1251	70	25	near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near
1252	70	21	me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze
1253	69	24	of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only
1254	72	23	person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only
1255	68	22	one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid
1256	68	21	inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen
1257	71	24	whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not;
1258	71	21	but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly
1259	67	21	did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings
1260	66	24	of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were
1261	67	21	assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
1262	62	18	tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.

1264	72	23	Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among
1265	71	22	flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation
1266	61	17	that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those
1267	66	19	black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those
1268	70	24	immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in
1269	71	23	the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to
1270	71	21	the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might
1271	53	17	those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.

1273	69	22	In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
1274	66	17	why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
1275	71	21	tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is
1276	70	20	that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
1277	70	21	so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
1278	68	19	he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the
1279	70	25	Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what
1280	68	20	eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
1281	66	23	antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we
1282	71	24	still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
1283	71	19	dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all
1284	72	22	the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a
1285	60	18	whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.

1287	68	20	But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these

1290	65	19	It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
1291	67	19	Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
1292	65	20	light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen
1293	69	22	who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But
1294	66	21	somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine
1295	65	22	chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an
1296	70	20	immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a
1297	68	20	speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what
1298	69	20	then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.
1299	63	16	Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
1300	67	21	substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too
1301	72	19	much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that
1302	71	18	thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my
1303	69	19	better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not
1304	71	23	me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and
1305	66	17	stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.

1309	22	5	CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
1310	0	0	
1311	0	0	
1312	64	23	I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
1313	71	22	robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
1314	71	22	admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
1315	70	20	sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it
1316	70	20	was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
1317	72	27	was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his
1318	70	20	youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.
1319	70	21	At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a
1320	71	21	healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second
1321	72	21	flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone
1322	67	20	certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure
1323	68	22	peeping forth even beneath February's snow. No one having previously
1324	72	21	heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without
1325	66	23	the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
1326	68	28	peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life
1327	71	22	he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and
1328	70	22	certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down
1329	69	20	with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to
1330	67	19	drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed.
1331	72	24	However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up
1332	72	23	in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit,
1333	33	11	he quietly approached the pulpit.
1334	0	0	
1335	69	21	Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
1336	72	20	regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
1337	71	22	seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect,
1338	69	21	it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the
1339	71	24	pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like
1340	71	24	those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling
1341	67	21	captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted
1342	65	18	man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and
1343	71	23	stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what
1344	69	20	manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for
1345	70	18	an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the
1346	69	20	ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards,
1347	71	21	and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand
1348	72	21	over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
1349	0	0	
1350	72	22	The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with
1351	72	22	swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,
1352	67	18	so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the
1353	65	20	pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
1354	70	22	these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not
1355	67	20	prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn
1356	68	21	round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
1357	62	17	step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
1358	33	11	impregnable in his little Quebec.
1359	0	0	
1360	69	22	I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
1361	72	23	Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
1362	69	20	that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks
1363	69	21	of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this
1364	66	19	thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be,
1365	72	22	then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual
1366	70	20	withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?
1367	72	21	Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful
1368	72	20	man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold--a lofty
1369	65	20	Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.
1370	0	0	
1371	66	20	But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
1372	67	20	borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings. Between the marble
1373	70	19	cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
1374	69	22	was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
1375	65	19	against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
1376	71	19	breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there
1377	69	20	floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's
1378	68	20	face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
1379	70	20	ship's tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
1380	66	16	the Victory's plank where Nelson fell. "Ah, noble ship," the angel
1381	67	21	seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
1382	65	18	helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
1383	32	10	off--serenest azure is at hand."
1384	0	0	
1385	68	22	Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
1386	66	20	had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in
1387	67	18	the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
1388	71	22	projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed
1389	5	2	beak.
1390	0	0	
1391	72	21	What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this earth's
1392	67	19	foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the
1393	64	15	world. From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is first
1394	69	20	descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is
1395	70	23	the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.
1396	70	21	Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;
1397	27	7	and the pulpit is its prow.

1404	71	25	Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
1405	70	22	the scattered people to condense. "Starboard gangway, there! side away
1406	64	17	to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!"

1408	68	21	There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a

1410	26	9	every eye on the preacher.

1412	72	21	He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his large
1413	67	18	brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered
1414	68	22	a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the
1415	18	6	bottom of the sea.

1417	68	21	This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of
1418	69	22	a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he
1419	69	18	commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
1420	71	20	the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy--

1448	68	18	Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
1449	70	21	howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
1450	69	20	over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
1451	71	20	the proper page, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the
1452	72	20	first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
1453	8	2	Jonah.'"
1454	0	0	
1455	72	21	"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is one
1456	71	17	of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what
1457	67	21	depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
1458	72	20	lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the
1459	72	20	fish's belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods
1460	69	19	surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;
1461	67	22	sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But WHAT is this
1462	70	21	lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded
1463	71	22	lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot
1464	70	22	of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it
1465	69	20	is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the
1466	70	20	swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and
1467	67	18	joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of
1468	67	23	Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never
1469	70	18	mind now what that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard
1470	72	20	command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to
1471	70	21	do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to
1472	69	23	persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in
1473	72	22	this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
1474	0	0	
1475	68	20	"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at
1476	72	18	God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will
1477	72	22	carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains
1478	69	20	of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship
1479	68	19	that's bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded
1480	68	21	meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city
1481	70	21	than the modern Cadiz. That's the opinion of learned men. And where is
1482	65	18	Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa,
1483	67	21	as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the
1484	68	22	Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa,
1485	66	21	shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the
1486	65	19	Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
1487	65	19	westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye
1488	67	18	not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?
1489	66	17	Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
1490	70	19	slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the
1491	72	22	shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered,
1492	67	21	self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those
1493	72	22	days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested
1494	69	23	ere he touched a deck. How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a
1495	70	19	hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf
1496	67	19	with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the
1497	71	20	Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on
1498	69	22	board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment
1499	67	19	desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil eye.
1500	70	24	Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence;
1501	70	22	in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure
1502	71	24	the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious
1503	70	19	way, one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's robbed a widow;" or, "Joe,
1504	67	18	do you mark him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry lad, I guess he's the
1505	72	24	adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing
1506	65	17	murderers from Sodom." Another runs to read the bill that's stuck
1507	70	21	against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering
1508	64	21	five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and
1509	70	22	containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah
1510	71	19	to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,
1511	66	18	prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and
1512	69	20	summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a
1513	72	18	coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong
1514	68	20	suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him
1515	72	19	not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends
1516	15	5	into the cabin.
1517	0	0	
1518	68	18	"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
1519	68	17	out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?' Oh! how that harmless
1520	70	22	question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
1521	68	21	But he rallies. 'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon
1522	68	20	sail ye, sir?' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,
1523	69	21	though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that
1524	68	20	hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. 'We sail with the
1525	68	18	next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing
1526	67	20	him. 'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest man that goes a
1527	69	17	passenger.' Ha! Jonah, that's another stab. But he swiftly calls away
1528	65	15	the Captain from that scent. 'I'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'the
1529	70	19	passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.' For it is particularly
1530	70	22	written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this
1531	68	20	history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere the craft did sail. And
1532	48	13	taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
1533	0	0	
1534	72	21	"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime
1535	68	20	in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this
1536	70	18	world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without
1537	69	22	a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.
1538	71	21	So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's purse, ere he
1539	72	21	judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it's assented
1540	68	21	to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same
1541	70	19	time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when
1542	69	21	Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the
1543	69	22	Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any
1544	69	19	way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. 'Point out my
1545	67	19	state-room, Sir,' says Jonah now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'
1546	67	19	'Thou lookest like it,' says the Captain, 'there's thy room.' Jonah
1547	70	20	enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing
1548	70	19	him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and
1549	72	22	mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed
1550	65	17	to be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws
1551	70	20	himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost
1552	68	20	resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in
1553	69	20	that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah
1554	70	20	feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale
1555	52	12	shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.

1557	63	17	"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
1558	72	21	oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf
1559	68	19	with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all,
1560	67	21	though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with
1561	71	20	reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it
1562	70	20	but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp
1563	68	18	alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes
1564	68	19	roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no
1565	71	21	refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more
1566	72	21	and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.
1567	71	18	'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it
1568	59	16	burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!'
1569	0	0	
1570	69	20	"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
1571	70	19	reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
1572	72	22	Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as
1573	72	19	one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,
1574	70	22	praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid
1575	69	22	the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the
1576	72	21	man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there's naught
1577	70	18	to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah's prodigy
1578	53	15	of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.

1580	70	19	"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
1581	71	20	from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
1582	63	16	glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
1583	68	18	smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not
1584	70	21	bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
1585	65	17	break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her;
1586	67	19	when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind
1587	68	18	is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
1588	72	20	trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah
1589	72	22	sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not
1590	72	21	the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the
1591	71	21	mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after
1592	70	21	him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship--a
1593	67	20	berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the
1594	66	19	frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, 'What
1595	68	19	meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!' Startled from his lethargy by that
1596	67	17	direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck,
1597	67	21	grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is
1598	69	20	sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after
1599	70	20	wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring
1600	71	21	fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.
1601	68	20	And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep
1602	64	21	gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing
1603	71	21	bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
1604	15	5	tormented deep.
1605	0	0	
1606	72	20	"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing
1607	70	22	attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark
1608	69	21	him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
1609	70	18	fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,
1610	72	21	they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
1611	71	20	upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously they
1612	70	22	mob him with their questions. 'What is thine occupation? Whence comest
1613	72	19	thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior
1614	66	21	of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where
1615	66	21	from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions,
1616	66	21	but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the
1617	71	20	unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is
1618	9	3	upon him.

1620	72	21	"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven
1621	69	19	who hath made the sea and the dry land!' Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well
1622	68	19	mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN! Straightway, he now goes on to
1623	67	24	make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
1624	69	20	appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating
1625	61	16	God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
1626	72	20	deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
1627	68	19	forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest
1628	72	19	was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to
1629	64	19	save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;
1630	69	19	then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not
1631	32	9	unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.
1632	0	0	
1633	69	21	"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
1634	69	20	when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
1635	65	19	is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth
1636	69	20	water behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
1637	69	21	commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
1638	68	20	the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory
1639	72	21	teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto
1640	69	19	the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a
1641	69	21	weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for
1642	69	21	direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He
1643	69	20	leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that
1644	69	18	spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy
1645	65	20	temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not
1646	70	21	clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to
1647	70	22	God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of
1648	70	22	him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before
1649	69	25	you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model
1650	70	23	for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like
1651	7	2	Jonah."

1653	64	18	While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
1654	68	20	slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
1655	68	18	when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
1656	72	21	His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the
1657	72	19	warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his
1658	69	18	swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple
1659	63	19	hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
1660	0	0	
1661	72	23	There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves
1662	69	20	of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed
1663	60	17	eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
1664	0	0	
1665	71	23	But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
1666	67	21	with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
1667	6	1	words:
1668	0	0	
1669	68	19	"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
1670	71	20	upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
1671	72	22	Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me,
1672	71	21	for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down
1673	67	19	from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and
1674	72	25	listen as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more
1675	69	21	awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God.
1676	67	21	How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and
1677	67	20	bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a
1678	70	22	wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled
1679	69	19	from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking
1680	70	21	ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we
1681	68	21	have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to
1682	71	19	living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the
1683	68	18	midst of the seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand
1684	70	20	fathoms down, and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the
1685	70	21	watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of
1686	69	19	any plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon
1687	71	21	the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting
1688	65	17	prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the
1689	66	19	shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching
1690	69	19	up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and
1691	70	19	earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of the
1692	70	23	Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears, like
1693	67	21	two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean--Jonah
1694	71	17	did the Almighty's bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the
1695	44	13	Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!
1696	0	0	
1697	69	19	"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
1698	69	16	the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from
1699	70	22	Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God
1700	71	23	has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than
1701	70	24	to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe
1702	69	20	to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour! Woe to him who would
1703	68	24	not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him
1704	65	20	who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is
1705	20	6	himself a castaway!"
1706	0	0	
1707	68	18	He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
1708	71	24	face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with
1709	68	20	a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
1710	71	21	every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
1711	69	20	than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than
1712	67	18	the kelson is low? Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward
1713	70	21	delight--who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever
1714	68	18	stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
1715	70	19	arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
1716	69	21	gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
1717	68	16	truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
1718	66	18	from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,--top-gallant
1719	68	18	delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his
1720	69	20	God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the
1721	70	23	waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
1722	70	23	from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness
1723	63	16	will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
1724	70	17	breath--O Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal,
1725	72	22	here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or
1726	72	22	mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man
1727	49	16	that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"
1728	0	0	
1729	71	23	He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
1730	70	21	his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
1731	35	11	and he was left alone in the place.

1738	68	23	Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
1739	72	26	quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time.
1740	69	21	He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove
1741	68	20	hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little
1742	68	21	negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife
1743	70	20	gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his
1744	15	5	heathenish way.
1745	0	0	
1746	70	21	But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
1747	67	21	to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
1748	70	24	began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
1749	71	22	page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
1750	69	20	giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He
1751	71	22	would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number
1752	71	22	one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was
1753	69	20	only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
1754	51	17	astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.
1755	0	0	
1756	64	18	With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and
1757	70	24	hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his countenance
1758	72	23	yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot
1759	68	21	hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw
1760	65	20	the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,
1761	71	22	fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
1762	72	22	thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing
1763	70	23	about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.
1764	72	23	He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor.
1765	71	21	Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn
1766	67	23	out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it
1767	70	23	otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was
1768	70	24	his head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous,
1769	71	23	but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular
1770	68	20	busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
1771	67	20	from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two
1772	71	24	long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington
1773	28	10	cannibalistically developed.
1774	0	0	
1775	71	19	Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
1776	72	22	looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,
1777	68	21	never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared
1778	63	20	wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.
1779	64	20	Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
1780	69	25	previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found
1781	70	21	thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference
1782	72	22	of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not
1783	70	20	know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm
1784	71	22	self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed
1785	71	22	also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
1786	71	25	other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have
1787	69	22	no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck
1788	69	19	me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something
1789	68	21	almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from
1790	71	18	home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could
1791	69	21	get there--thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in
1792	70	23	the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving
1793	72	22	the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to
1794	71	21	himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he
1795	67	18	had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be
1796	69	22	true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or
1797	68	20	so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself
1798	72	22	out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he
1799	32	9	must have "broken his digester."

1801	69	20	As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
1802	70	19	mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
1803	69	20	only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering
1804	67	21	round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain;
1805	69	21	the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of
1806	69	20	strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart
1807	70	20	and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing
1808	70	24	savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a
1809	72	23	nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits.
1810	70	19	Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself
1811	69	19	mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have
1812	72	18	repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I'll
1813	70	19	try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but
1814	71	19	hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
1815	71	18	and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little
1816	68	19	noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last
1817	72	25	night's hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
1818	72	22	bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps
1819	22	7	a little complimented.

1821	69	24	We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
1822	68	20	him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
1823	72	21	that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went
1824	72	25	to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen
1825	67	22	in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing
1826	69	21	his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat
1827	69	19	exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly
1828	19	6	passing between us.
1829	0	0	
1830	69	22	If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's
1831	72	22	breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left
1832	72	25	us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as
1833	70	23	I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against
1834	66	20	mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were
1835	70	20	married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we were bosom friends;
1836	68	20	he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this
1837	71	24	sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing
1838	70	21	to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would
1839	10	2	not apply.

1841	68	22	After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
1842	65	22	together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
1843	64	21	enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out
1844	68	18	some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
1845	70	23	mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them
1846	68	21	towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he
1847	71	18	silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them stay.
1848	70	23	He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
1849	71	20	the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed
1850	66	20	anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I
1851	70	23	deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or
1852	10	4	otherwise.

1854	68	21	I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
1855	70	21	Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
1856	65	19	worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do
1857	64	22	you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
1858	61	19	earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an
1859	72	21	insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?--to do
1860	72	18	the will of God--THAT is worship. And what is the will of God?--to do to
1861	70	19	my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me--THAT is the
1862	68	19	will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that
1863	65	21	this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular
1864	70	20	Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him
1865	69	20	in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped
1866	64	19	prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
1867	71	24	Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
1868	69	22	done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
1869	71	20	and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.

1871	71	23	How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
1872	72	21	disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very
1873	67	23	bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie
1874	71	19	and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts'
1875	51	18	honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving pair.

1882	69	18	We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
1883	69	23	Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
1884	68	21	over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
1885	70	22	and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
1886	71	23	little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
1887	68	21	getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
1888	0	0	
1889	67	22	Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
1890	68	22	began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
1891	66	20	sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
1892	67	22	head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
1893	70	21	noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt
1894	68	20	very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
1895	67	23	indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
1896	68	21	room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
1897	69	19	small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world
1898	71	18	that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If
1899	72	25	you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so
1900	72	23	a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if,
1901	66	22	like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
1902	66	18	of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
1903	72	21	consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this
1904	72	23	reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which
1905	71	22	is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this
1906	72	24	sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
1907	72	24	your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the
1908	49	13	one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.

1910	71	21	We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
1911	69	21	once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether
1912	71	21	by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
1913	67	20	keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness
1914	69	23	of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
1915	72	23	except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element
1916	72	24	of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon
1917	72	21	opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created
1918	69	25	darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
1919	72	25	twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did
1920	70	22	I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to
1921	70	23	strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt
1922	72	23	a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,
1923	69	19	that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the
1924	72	22	bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
1925	68	20	love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to
1926	70	25	have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full
1927	70	22	of such serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for
1928	69	21	the landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed
1929	72	24	confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
1930	72	21	friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
1931	68	20	the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a
1932	69	21	blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit
1933	5	1	lamp.
1934	0	0	
1935	72	22	Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
1936	71	20	distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,
1937	71	21	eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly
1938	68	21	complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his
1939	71	23	words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with
1940	72	21	his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as
1941	41	14	it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.

1948	69	25	Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
1949	56	17	South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.

1951	68	22	When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
1952	68	20	a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
1953	72	25	sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire
1954	71	22	to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His
1955	68	19	father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the
1956	66	24	maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
1957	69	20	warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins--royal stuff; though
1958	70	22	sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
1959	16	6	untutored youth.

1961	65	21	A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a
1962	71	19	passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of
1963	69	20	seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's influence
1964	71	26	could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled
1965	70	17	off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when
1966	72	24	she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low
1967	69	21	tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the
1968	69	20	water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its
1969	72	18	prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the
1970	70	20	ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with
1971	69	21	one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up
1972	71	17	the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled
1973	71	21	a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.

1975	66	22	In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
1976	66	20	cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
1977	72	21	Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild
1978	67	20	desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told
1979	71	22	him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage--this sea
1980	71	20	Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin. They put him down among
1981	71	22	the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to
1982	70	26	toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming
1983	72	21	ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his
1984	72	22	untutored countrymen. For at bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a
1985	66	20	profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to
1986	65	19	make his people still happier than they were; and more than that,
1987	70	20	still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon
1988	70	21	convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked;
1989	70	21	infinitely more so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last in
1990	72	21	old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on
1991	71	21	to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,
1992	69	22	poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in
1993	32	11	all meridians; I'll die a pagan.
1994	0	0	
1995	71	22	And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
1996	70	22	wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
1997	47	15	ways about him, though now some time from home.
1998	0	0	
1999	71	19	By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
2000	70	23	a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
2001	72	21	being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet;
2002	69	20	and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had
2003	72	22	unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan
2004	70	19	Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as
2005	70	22	he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to
2006	69	23	sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a
2007	69	23	harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
2008	0	0	
2009	68	23	I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
2010	69	24	movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
2011	71	17	this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
2012	72	23	intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for
2013	72	24	an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany
2014	72	21	me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,
2015	69	19	the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap;
2016	70	15	with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds.
2017	69	22	To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt
2018	70	25	for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not
2019	72	23	fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant
2020	68	21	of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as
2021	25	7	known to merchant seamen.

2023	72	21	His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced
2024	68	21	me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we
2025	66	19	rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were
2026	9	3	sleeping.

2032	71	21	Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
2033	68	17	for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using, however, my
2034	71	20	comrade's money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
2035	70	19	amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
2036	67	22	me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's cock and bull stories
2037	70	22	about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
2038	26	8	whom I now companied with.
2039	0	0	
2040	69	20	We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
2041	69	21	poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went
2042	70	20	down to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the
2043	64	22	wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg
2044	65	21	so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
2045	71	21	streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
2046	71	22	heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg
2047	72	20	now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked
2048	64	19	him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
2049	70	18	whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in
2050	69	21	substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet
2051	68	24	he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
2052	70	21	assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
2053	61	17	with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers
2054	65	19	and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows armed with their own
2055	70	22	scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them--even so, Queequeg,
2056	55	17	for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.
2057	0	0	
2058	71	18	Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
2059	72	21	the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners
2060	62	16	of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
2061	65	22	heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the
2062	72	20	thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
2063	70	22	which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it
2064	68	15	fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. "Why,"
2065	67	22	said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
2066	32	8	think. Didn't the people laugh?"
2067	0	0	
2068	64	19	Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of
2069	70	21	Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
2070	70	24	of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and
2071	69	19	this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
2072	67	19	mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
2073	65	20	touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts, a very
2074	63	21	stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain--this
2075	66	22	commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a
2076	68	16	pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding
2077	65	21	guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain
2078	70	21	marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over
2079	70	19	against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the
2080	71	24	King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,--for those people have their
2081	72	23	grace as well as we--though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such
2082	72	19	times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the
2083	69	19	ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say,
2084	72	23	being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony
2085	72	20	of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
2086	68	23	into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself
2087	61	16	placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking
2088	67	22	himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a
2089	72	22	mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain coolly
2090	71	20	proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I suppose for a
2091	72	21	huge finger-glass. "Now," said Queequeg, "what you tink now?--Didn't our
2092	14	5	people laugh?"
2093	0	0	
2094	72	23	At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.
2095	66	21	Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New
2096	64	21	Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all
2097	71	21	glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on
2098	71	20	casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering
2099	67	19	whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others
2100	72	23	came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and
2101	69	20	forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the
2102	66	20	start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a
2103	68	19	second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever
2104	69	21	and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all
2105	15	4	earthly effort.

2107	71	22	Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
2108	72	19	Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.
2109	72	20	How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that turnpike earth!--that
2110	66	18	common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and
2111	68	21	hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will
2112	18	5	permit no records.
2113	0	0	
2114	69	25	At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
2115	72	20	His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth.
2116	65	20	On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the
2117	71	21	blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways
2118	69	22	leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the
2119	71	21	two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of
2120	70	19	this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that
2121	72	23	for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a
2122	71	20	lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
2123	72	25	companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
2124	71	23	whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,
2125	71	21	by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of
2126	70	24	all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him
2127	72	20	behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping
2128	71	19	his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
2129	72	21	miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;
2130	71	17	then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with
2131	72	22	bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,
2132	57	17	lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.
2133	0	0	
2134	69	17	"Capting! Capting!" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
2135	37	9	"Capting, Capting, here's the devil."
2136	0	0	
2137	71	21	"Hallo, _you_ sir," cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
2138	72	23	up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do you mean by that? Don't you know you
2139	29	7	might have killed that chap?"
2140	0	0	
2141	57	17	"What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
2142	0	0	
2143	70	21	"He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there," pointing
2144	33	9	to the still shivering greenhorn.
2145	0	0	
2146	70	24	"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
2147	71	23	expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e
2148	46	15	so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"
2149	0	0	
2150	70	24	"Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you
2151	59	18	try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."
2152	0	0	
2153	70	20	But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
2154	69	23	mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
2155	70	21	the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
2156	69	21	side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor
2157	69	21	fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
2158	71	20	hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
2159	66	18	seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost
2160	67	21	in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
2161	72	21	snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of
2162	71	21	being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the
2163	64	22	boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the
2164	70	21	midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and
2165	72	22	crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one
2166	72	20	end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it
2167	72	20	round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar
2168	69	19	was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the
2169	70	22	wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,
2170	69	19	stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of
2171	66	22	a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,
2172	70	19	throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing
2173	69	20	his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand
2174	71	23	and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone
2175	68	21	down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now
2176	72	22	took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters
2177	72	25	were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again,
2178	72	20	one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.
2179	70	20	The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands
2180	70	22	voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that
2181	70	29	hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took
2182	19	5	his last long dive.
2183	0	0	
2184	72	22	Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at
2185	71	25	all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only
2186	67	19	asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that
2187	70	20	done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the
2188	65	20	bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying
2189	67	19	to himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
2190	38	10	cannibals must help these Christians."

2197	71	22	Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
2198	41	13	fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
2199	0	0	
2200	70	24	Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of
2201	71	21	the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
2202	71	22	than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it--a mere hillock, and elbow of
2203	68	20	sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than
2204	70	23	you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
2205	71	20	gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
2206	70	18	don't grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have
2207	67	21	to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that
2208	67	25	pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
2209	70	23	cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,
2210	71	22	to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an
2211	71	23	oasis, three blades in a day's walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand
2212	69	20	shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
2213	70	23	belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
2214	70	18	of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
2215	70	22	sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
2216	54	17	extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.
2217	0	0	
2218	65	20	Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
2219	69	20	settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle
2220	66	20	swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant
2221	72	21	Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne
2222	70	22	out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same
2223	69	25	direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they
2224	71	20	discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,--the
2225	30	10	poor little Indian's skeleton.
2226	0	0	
2227	72	20	What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take
2228	67	21	to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in
2229	67	18	the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
2230	68	20	experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
2231	71	20	launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
2232	62	21	put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in
2233	64	19	at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
2234	70	21	everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
2235	69	22	flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea
2236	69	21	Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
2237	65	20	his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
2238	19	8	malicious assaults!
2239	0	0	
2240	71	22	And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
2241	70	22	their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like
2242	72	22	so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and
2243	69	24	Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add
2244	69	23	Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm
2245	69	19	all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds
2246	71	24	of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he
2247	68	21	owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of
2248	72	21	way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but
2249	69	22	floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea
2250	72	19	as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of
2251	71	21	the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the
2252	70	23	bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on
2253	70	23	the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and
2254	72	23	fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. THERE is his home; THERE
2255	70	21	lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it
2256	70	24	overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie
2257	65	19	cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as
2258	67	17	chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so
2259	68	19	that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more
2260	70	18	strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull,
2261	70	19	that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows;
2262	72	19	so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails,
2263	67	17	and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of
2264	20	6	walruses and whales.

2269	0	0	
2270	0	0	
2271	65	20	It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly
2272	67	23	to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
2273	72	21	business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of
2274	68	23	the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the
2275	71	20	Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
2276	67	22	hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin
2277	66	19	Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he
2278	72	18	plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at
2279	71	22	the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow
2280	68	23	warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
2281	67	20	larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
2282	71	19	corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
2283	68	21	man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very
2284	64	21	much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg
2285	70	23	insisted that the yellow warehouse--our first point of departure--must
2286	70	22	be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to
2287	71	22	say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little
2288	64	20	in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant
2289	67	21	to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
2290	10	3	mistaking.
2291	0	0	
2292	69	21	Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,
2293	69	17	swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
2294	69	20	old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other
2295	67	20	side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.
2296	67	22	Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I
2297	72	21	could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of
2298	71	19	crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, TWO
2299	68	23	of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A
2300	69	18	Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones
2301	70	21	staring at me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair
2302	71	24	of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints
2303	16	5	touching Tophet?
2304	0	0	
2305	68	19	I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
2306	69	18	with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
2307	70	21	under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured
2308	68	20	eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
2309	6	1	shirt.
2310	0	0	
2311	66	17	"Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"
2312	0	0	
2313	62	17	"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right. There's Mrs. Hussey."
2314	0	0	
2315	67	21	And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
2316	65	19	Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon
2317	72	20	making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing
2318	68	20	further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and
2319	68	21	seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded
2320	51	14	repast, turned round to us and said--"Clam or Cod?"
2321	0	0	
2322	62	17	"What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much politeness.
2323	0	0	
2324	28	8	"Clam or Cod?" she repeated.
2325	0	0	
2326	69	17	"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"
2327	68	18	says I, "but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
2328	29	7	time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"
2329	0	0	
2330	67	20	But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
2331	71	20	Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
2332	72	20	but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to
2333	57	16	the kitchen, and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.
2334	0	0	
2335	70	24	"Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for us
2336	18	5	both on one clam?"
2337	0	0	
2338	65	20	However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
2339	70	19	apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
2340	67	18	came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
2341	69	19	hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
2342	72	21	hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into
2343	71	21	little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned
2344	65	18	with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty
2345	69	27	voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food
2346	71	20	before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched
2347	67	21	it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking
2348	68	18	me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try
2349	69	21	a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word
2350	68	19	"cod" with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the
2351	72	23	savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good
2352	45	15	time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
2353	0	0	
2354	70	20	We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I
2355	64	18	to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?
2356	70	21	What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? "But look,
2357	68	24	Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?"
2358	0	0	
2359	66	16	Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved
2360	70	20	its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
2361	67	18	breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
2362	66	21	began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area
2363	72	21	before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished
2364	68	22	necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books
2365	71	20	bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk,
2366	69	21	too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening
2367	68	21	to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw
2368	69	19	Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the
2369	72	22	sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slip-shod,
2370	12	5	I assure ye.
2371	0	0	
2372	69	20	Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
2373	72	25	concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede
2374	66	18	me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his
2375	67	19	harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. "Why not?" said I;
2376	68	20	"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why not?" "Because
2377	68	18	it's dangerous," says she. "Ever since young Stiggs coming from that
2378	69	18	unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
2379	72	19	only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back, with
2380	68	23	his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take
2381	70	22	sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg" (for
2382	69	21	she had learned his name), "I will just take this here iron, and keep
2383	67	18	it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for
2384	16	4	breakfast, men?"
2385	0	0	
2386	68	18	"Both," says I; "and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of
2387	9	3	variety."

2394	68	19	In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and
2395	70	22	no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
2396	70	20	diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--and Yojo
2397	67	19	had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
2398	71	23	everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
2399	72	21	harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo
2400	68	20	earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly
2401	67	21	with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to
2402	70	19	do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,
2403	69	19	Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it
2404	68	20	had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship
2405	49	16	myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
2406	0	0	
2407	71	23	I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
2408	71	22	confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising forecast
2409	72	23	of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good
2410	69	20	sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all
2411	48	15	cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
2412	0	0	
2413	70	22	Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection
2414	72	22	of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied
2415	69	23	upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry
2416	66	20	us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced
2417	68	25	no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly
2418	66	21	prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort
2419	68	18	of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little
2420	69	24	affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our
2421	71	22	little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan,
2422	70	24	or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that
2423	68	20	day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself
2424	65	21	to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX
2425	72	24	Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo
2426	72	24	warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among
2427	72	22	the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries,
2428	69	21	I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The
2429	68	19	Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the
2430	70	24	origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was
2431	68	22	the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct
2432	71	22	as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her,
2433	67	20	hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod,
2434	71	21	looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very
2435	12	3	ship for us.

2437	62	21	You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
2438	66	22	know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
2439	69	19	galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
2440	70	21	rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old
2441	72	21	school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look
2442	70	22	about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms
2443	72	22	of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French
2444	69	23	grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable
2445	68	21	bows looked bearded. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,
2446	70	24	where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood
2447	65	18	stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her
2448	65	18	ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped
2449	70	20	flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these
2450	71	26	her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
2451	72	20	to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.
2452	65	21	Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded
2453	67	22	another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the
2454	71	20	principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his
2455	69	24	chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid
2456	70	23	it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched
2457	72	19	by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She
2458	71	24	was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with
2459	70	21	pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of
2460	71	20	a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All
2461	71	25	round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous
2462	69	18	jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for
2463	72	18	pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not
2464	70	20	through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of
2465	71	21	sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported
2466	65	20	there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved
2467	70	20	from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who
2468	72	19	steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds
2469	71	19	back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a
2470	56	15	most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.

2472	72	25	Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,
2473	72	23	in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw
2474	64	19	nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or
2475	68	20	rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only
2476	70	24	a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten
2477	72	20	feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken
2478	64	16	from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.
2479	72	20	Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced
2480	71	23	together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in
2481	70	23	a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the
2482	70	24	top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening
2483	67	19	faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a
2484	22	7	complete view forward.
2485	0	0	
2486	68	22	And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who
2487	67	21	by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and
2488	70	19	the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
2489	69	22	command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
2490	66	20	over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a
2491	67	20	stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
2492	12	3	constructed.
2493	0	0	
2494	70	23	There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
2495	69	18	the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
2496	67	20	and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;
2497	69	21	only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
2498	64	19	wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from
2499	64	20	his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
2500	70	22	windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
2501	58	18	together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
2502	0	0	
2503	69	22	"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the door of
2504	9	2	the tent.
2505	0	0	
2506	72	21	"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?"
2507	12	4	he demanded.
2508	0	0	
2509	29	7	"I was thinking of shipping."
2510	0	0	
2511	68	23	"Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in a
2512	12	4	stove boat?"
2513	0	0	
2514	24	7	"No, Sir, I never have."
2515	0	0	
2516	56	16	"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?
2517	0	0	
2518	72	23	"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I've been several
2519	52	14	voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--"
2520	0	0	
2521	69	19	"Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that
2522	69	18	leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of
2523	72	24	the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now
2524	68	21	ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships.
2525	68	19	But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?--it looks
2526	64	20	a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not been a pirate, hast
2527	69	16	thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?--Dost not think of
2528	49	15	murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?"
2529	0	0	
2530	67	19	I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask
2531	67	24	of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
2532	69	22	Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
2533	66	20	distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
2534	9	3	Vineyard.
2535	0	0	
2536	69	20	"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
2537	13	3	shipping ye."
2538	0	0	
2539	68	18	"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world."
2540	0	0	
2541	71	22	"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?"
2542	0	0	
2543	27	8	"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"
2544	0	0	
2545	67	21	"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."
2546	0	0	
2547	70	21	"I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself."
2548	0	0	
2549	67	21	"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,
2550	71	23	young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
2551	71	21	out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
2552	70	21	are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest
2553	72	21	to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of
2554	68	21	finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap
2555	71	22	eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one
2556	5	1	leg."
2557	0	0	
2558	59	17	"What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?"
2559	0	0	
2560	64	20	"Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,
2561	70	19	chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
2562	15	4	boat!--ah, ah!"
2563	0	0	
2564	70	22	I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
2565	71	22	the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I
2566	71	22	could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
2567	71	24	there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
2568	68	19	I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident."
2569	0	0	
2570	69	19	"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou
2571	70	22	dost not talk shark a bit. SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure of
2572	6	1	that?"
2573	0	0	
2574	72	23	"Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the
2575	11	2	merchant--"
2576	0	0	
2577	59	17	"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant
2578	72	22	service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it. But let us understand each
2579	69	23	other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel
2580	17	5	inclined for it?"
2581	0	0	
2582	12	3	"I do, sir."
2583	0	0	
2584	72	21	"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's
2585	47	12	throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!"
2586	0	0	
2587	72	23	"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be
2588	56	14	got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact."
2589	0	0	
2590	69	20	"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find
2591	69	22	out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to
2592	71	18	see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just
2593	71	21	step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back
2594	37	11	to me and tell me what ye see there."
2595	0	0	
2596	66	21	For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
2597	69	21	knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
2598	71	21	concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started
2599	17	5	me on the errand.
2600	0	0	
2601	69	21	Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
2602	66	19	ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
2603	64	20	pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but
2604	71	22	exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I
2605	10	4	could see.
2606	0	0	
2607	68	17	"Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye
2608	5	2	see?"
2609	0	0	
2610	71	21	"Not much," I replied--"nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
2611	41	11	and there's a squall coming up, I think."
2612	0	0	
2613	70	19	"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
2614	71	22	round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where
2615	11	3	you stand?"
2616	0	0	
2617	71	21	I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
2618	72	21	Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all this I now
2619	72	24	repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness
2620	11	3	to ship me.
2621	0	0	
2622	68	18	"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off," he added--"come
2623	72	20	along with ye." And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
2624	0	0	
2625	63	20	Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
2626	69	22	surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with
2627	68	21	Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
2628	70	20	shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
2629	72	19	of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each
2630	70	25	owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail
2631	69	21	or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling
2632	64	19	vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks
2633	26	8	bringing in good interest.
2634	0	0	
2635	66	20	Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
2636	70	20	Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to
2637	69	24	this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
2638	68	27	peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified
2639	68	24	by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same
2640	70	22	Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
2641	56	19	are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
2642	0	0	
2643	72	21	So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture
2644	66	20	names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in childhood
2645	67	22	naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker
2646	65	22	idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure
2647	64	19	of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown
2648	66	22	peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a
2649	71	23	Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things
2650	71	25	unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain
2651	66	20	and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion
2652	62	17	of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath
2653	62	19	constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
2654	66	22	untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet or
2655	68	20	savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
2656	63	17	breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
2657	70	22	advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes
2658	69	23	one in a whole nation's census--a mighty pageant creature, formed for
2659	66	19	noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically
2660	71	21	regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
2661	72	22	a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all
2662	70	23	men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure
2663	68	22	of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But,
2664	70	22	as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and
2665	72	23	still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another
2666	58	20	phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
2667	0	0	
2668	70	23	Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
2669	66	21	But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called
2670	68	23	serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
2671	67	21	veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally
2672	72	22	educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all
2673	70	21	his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island
2674	66	19	creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born
2675	66	22	Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
2676	63	17	vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of
2677	68	20	common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from
2678	71	22	conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
2679	72	23	had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe
2680	72	21	to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns
2681	72	24	upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his
2682	72	23	days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
2683	68	17	not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
2684	71	22	he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's
2685	67	21	religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This
2686	69	18	world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes
2687	72	24	of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;
2688	70	22	from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a
2689	69	22	ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous
2690	63	20	career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of
2691	70	23	sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his
2692	19	7	well-earned income.
2693	0	0	
2694	62	19	Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
2695	65	19	incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
2696	67	19	task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
2697	70	21	curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
2698	72	24	upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore
2699	72	25	exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was
2700	72	22	certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,
2701	63	20	though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate
2702	71	22	quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a
2703	71	25	chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made
2704	70	22	you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer
2705	67	20	or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,
2706	68	21	never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own
2707	68	23	person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his
2708	66	20	long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard,
2709	70	21	his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his
2710	18	5	broad-brimmed hat.
2711	0	0	
2712	66	18	Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
2713	71	22	followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
2714	70	17	was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,
2715	69	21	and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was
2716	70	19	placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was
2717	70	22	buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
2718	32	12	reading from a ponderous volume.
2719	0	0	
2720	69	22	"Bildad," cried Captain Peleg, "at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
2721	72	18	studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain
2722	35	9	knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?"
2723	0	0	
2724	65	20	As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
2725	72	24	Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and
2726	51	17	seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
2727	0	0	
2728	63	16	"He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he wants to ship."
2729	0	0	
2730	68	20	"Dost thee?" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
2731	0	0	
2732	59	20	"I dost," said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
2733	0	0	
2734	46	12	"What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.
2735	0	0	
2736	69	19	"He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
2737	42	16	his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
2738	0	0	
2739	70	24	I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,
2740	64	20	his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said
2741	69	18	nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,
2742	69	18	and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him,
2743	71	22	and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time
2744	72	20	to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the
2745	69	23	voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no
2746	71	22	wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of
2747	69	20	the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the
2748	70	24	degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's
2749	68	20	company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own
2750	72	22	lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,
2751	69	21	could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that
2752	69	19	from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that
2753	68	19	is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever
2754	71	18	that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they
2755	71	19	call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a
2756	71	20	lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out
2757	72	21	on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would
2758	27	9	not have to pay one stiver.
2759	0	0	
2760	69	21	It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
2761	69	23	fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
2762	71	23	that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
2763	72	21	world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim
2764	71	18	sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay
2765	70	23	would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I
2766	69	22	been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
2767	0	0	
2768	68	21	But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
2769	71	24	receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
2770	71	22	something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
2771	70	22	how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore
2772	71	22	the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the
2773	71	21	whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know
2774	68	19	but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
2775	66	20	shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
2776	68	23	quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
2777	70	20	own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
2778	72	19	jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was
2779	66	21	such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded
2780	68	19	us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, "LAY not up for
2781	46	15	yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth--"
2782	0	0	
2783	67	17	"Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay
2784	30	8	shall we give this young man?"
2785	0	0	
2786	69	17	"Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred and
2787	72	19	seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust do
2788	20	4	corrupt, but LAY--'"
2789	0	0	
2790	61	17	LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
2791	70	21	seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
2792	70	18	shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.
2793	64	18	It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the
2794	65	21	magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
2795	67	19	the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
2796	66	20	seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make
2797	68	20	a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and
2798	65	19	seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
2799	71	21	hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
2800	0	0	
2801	67	17	"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "thou dost not want to
2802	53	14	swindle this young man! he must have more than that."
2803	0	0	
2804	71	21	"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without lifting
2805	71	21	his eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your treasure is, there
2806	25	8	will your heart be also."
2807	0	0	
2808	72	20	"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg, "do ye
2809	51	13	hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say."
2810	0	0	
2811	65	18	Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
2812	70	23	"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the
2813	69	19	duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans,
2814	69	19	many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
2815	65	19	young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
2816	67	18	orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg."
2817	0	0	
2818	65	20	"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
2819	71	21	cabin. "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these
2820	70	24	matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
2821	68	23	heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
2822	6	1	Horn."
2823	0	0	
2824	69	20	"Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be drawing
2825	72	19	ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still
2826	71	22	an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be
2827	69	21	but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the
2828	26	8	fiery pit, Captain Peleg."
2829	0	0	
2830	70	20	"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
2831	68	22	insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
2832	72	20	he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and
2833	71	17	start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live goat with
2834	70	21	all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured
2835	46	14	son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!"
2836	0	0	
2837	72	23	As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous
2838	59	19	oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
2839	0	0	
2840	63	20	Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
2841	66	20	responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up
2842	69	25	all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
2843	71	22	commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,
2844	69	24	I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
2845	64	18	wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
2846	71	22	transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
2847	70	23	withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As
2848	69	22	for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
2849	68	19	left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
2850	72	19	little as if still nervously agitated. "Whew!" he whistled at last--"the
2851	70	22	squall's gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at
2852	68	18	sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
2853	68	15	the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,
2854	71	18	Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
2855	29	7	for the three hundredth lay."
2856	0	0	
2857	67	20	"Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship
2858	39	10	too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?"
2859	0	0	
2860	67	18	"To be sure," said Peleg. "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."
2861	0	0	
2862	69	19	"What lay does he want?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
2863	40	12	which he had again been burying himself.
2864	0	0	
2865	66	20	"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg. "Has he ever
2866	30	8	whaled it any?" turning to me.
2867	0	0	
2868	53	16	"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."
2869	0	0	
2870	29	6	"Well, bring him along then."
2871	0	0	
2872	70	19	And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I
2873	69	21	had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical
2874	68	22	ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
2875	0	0	
2876	72	22	But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain
2877	69	22	with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in
2878	71	22	many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all
2879	68	21	her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving
2880	70	23	to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the
2881	70	23	shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have
2882	72	21	a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble
2883	70	20	himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till
2884	69	23	all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at
2885	71	21	him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back
2886	71	25	I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
2887	0	0	
2888	69	20	"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou
2889	13	3	art shipped."
2890	0	0	
2891	36	11	"Yes, but I should like to see him."
2892	0	0	
2893	72	19	"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly
2894	71	21	what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort
2895	69	18	of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he
2896	67	19	isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I
2897	67	22	don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some
2898	68	21	think--but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no
2899	70	20	fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak
2900	68	18	much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be
2901	72	23	forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as
2902	70	21	'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed
2903	66	19	his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance!
2904	70	23	aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't
2905	72	22	Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab
2906	42	11	of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!"
2907	0	0	
2908	68	18	"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
2909	25	6	they not lick his blood?"
2910	0	0	
2911	71	22	"Come hither to me--hither, hither," said Peleg, with a significance in
2912	71	20	his eye that almost startled me. "Look ye, lad; never say that on board
2913	69	22	the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
2914	69	20	'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died
2915	68	18	when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at
2916	72	22	Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps,
2917	72	22	other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It's a
2918	70	24	lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years ago;
2919	70	22	I know what he is--a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but
2920	72	24	a swearing good man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of
2921	70	19	him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on
2922	69	21	the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it
2923	68	18	was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
2924	65	21	about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost
2925	63	18	his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of
2926	68	21	moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass
2927	72	21	off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's
2928	68	23	better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So
2929	67	22	good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to
2930	69	22	have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages
2931	70	17	wedded--a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that
2932	66	18	old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless
2933	71	18	harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
2934	12	5	humanities!"
2935	0	0	
2936	61	18	As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
2937	69	24	incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
2938	71	22	wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,
2939	66	16	I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know what,
2940	70	20	unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange
2941	69	20	awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was
2942	69	19	not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did
2943	70	23	not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed
2944	72	19	like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However,
2945	71	20	my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the
2946	34	8	present dark Ahab slipped my mind.

2953	70	26	As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
2954	67	18	day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
2955	71	23	cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations,
2956	71	22	never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
2957	68	23	even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
2958	72	25	creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism
2959	66	22	quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of
2960	64	24	a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate
2961	45	14	possessions yet owned and rented in his name.
2962	0	0	
2963	68	22	I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
2964	68	19	things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
2965	66	20	pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
2966	66	21	subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
2967	70	24	absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that? Queequeg
2968	70	22	thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
2969	69	21	and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let
2970	72	21	him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all--Presbyterians and Pagans
2971	68	23	alike--for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
2972	19	5	sadly need mending.

2974	66	19	Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
2975	72	22	rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but
2976	70	24	no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. "Queequeg,"
2977	70	20	said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent. "I say, Queequeg! why
2978	70	22	don't you speak? It's I--Ishmael." But all remained still as before. I
2979	70	22	began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought
2980	71	22	he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but
2981	70	22	the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect
2982	64	21	was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the
2983	65	20	foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I
2984	68	20	was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of
2985	69	23	Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken
2986	72	20	from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That's strange, thought I;
2987	66	19	but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or
2988	70	25	never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no
2989	17	6	possible mistake.
2990	0	0	
2991	64	21	"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all still. Something must have happened.
2992	69	20	Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
2993	71	19	Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
2994	71	19	I met--the chamber-maid. "La! la!" she cried, "I thought something must
2995	71	21	be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
2996	70	22	locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it's been just so silent ever
2997	67	20	since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
2998	67	18	baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma'am!--Mistress! murder! Mrs.
2999	72	19	Hussey! apoplexy!"--and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I
3000	10	3	following.
3001	0	0	
3002	63	19	Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
3003	71	23	vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
3004	72	20	of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.
3005	0	0	
3006	70	19	"Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it? Run for God's sake, and fetch
3007	69	20	something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a stroke;
3008	70	21	depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
3009	67	18	again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
3010	56	19	vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
3011	0	0	
3012	40	10	"What's the matter with you, young man?"
3013	0	0	
3014	71	20	"Get the axe! For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry
3015	9	3	it open!"
3016	0	0	
3017	71	20	"Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,
3018	69	24	so as to have one hand free; "look here; are you talking about prying
3019	68	16	open any of my doors?"--and with that she seized my arm. "What's the
3020	55	15	matter with you? What's the matter with you, shipmate?"
3021	0	0	
3022	72	22	In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the
3023	71	24	whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
3024	71	22	nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--"No! I haven't seen
3025	70	21	it since I put it there." Running to a little closet under the landing
3026	69	20	of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg's
3027	72	19	harpoon was missing. "He's killed himself," she cried. "It's unfort'nate
3028	72	25	Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane--God pity his poor
3029	68	20	mother!--it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad a sister?
3030	69	17	Where's that girl?--there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell
3031	65	20	him to paint me a sign, with--"no suicides permitted here, and no
3032	69	16	smoking in the parlor;"--might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?
3033	70	20	The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What's that noise there? You, young
3034	18	5	man, avast there!"
3035	0	0	
3036	69	21	And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
3037	14	5	open the door.
3038	0	0	
3039	63	18	"I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled. Go for the
3040	70	21	locksmith, there's one about a mile from here. But avast!" putting her
3041	66	17	hand in her side-pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess; let's
3042	69	20	see." And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg's
3043	46	14	supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

3045	65	18	"Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a
3046	70	20	little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing
3047	69	20	I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a
3048	55	14	sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.
3049	0	0	
3050	65	21	With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
3051	66	19	against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
3052	70	23	heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right
3053	69	20	in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on
3054	69	22	top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
3055	54	19	like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.
3056	0	0	
3057	70	23	"Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter with
3058	5	2	you?"
3059	0	0	
3060	65	18	"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.
3061	0	0	
3062	67	20	But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
3063	70	22	like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
3064	64	22	intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
3065	71	22	especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
3066	56	19	eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
3067	0	0	
3068	69	21	"Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you
3069	54	16	please, and I will see to this strange affair myself."
3070	0	0	
3071	64	22	Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
3072	69	24	Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could
3073	70	19	do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move a peg,
3074	69	21	nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
3075	18	4	the slightest way.
3076	0	0	
3077	70	20	I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
3078	69	19	they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
3079	71	17	yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll
3080	68	19	get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can't last for ever, thank God,
3081	69	22	and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't believe it's very
3082	14	4	punctual then.
3083	0	0	
3084	70	20	I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
3085	72	23	stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as
3086	70	20	they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,
3087	69	21	confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after
3088	69	20	listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I went
3089	69	24	up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must
3090	69	23	certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he
3091	69	19	was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to
3092	70	21	grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be
3093	68	18	sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
3094	36	13	holding a piece of wood on his head.
3095	0	0	
3096	72	24	"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
3097	70	22	some supper. You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg." But not a
3098	18	4	word did he reply.
3099	0	0	
3100	69	23	Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
3101	71	24	and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
3102	70	20	turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
3103	72	20	it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary
3104	68	22	round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into
3105	67	20	the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought
3106	70	25	of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position,
3107	72	19	stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of
3108	70	23	it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his
3109	43	14	hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
3110	0	0	
3111	70	20	But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
3112	70	24	day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he
3113	71	20	had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of
3114	65	17	sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints,
3115	68	20	but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his
3116	59	22	forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
3117	0	0	
3118	70	24	Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion,
3119	69	19	be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
3120	71	23	other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when
3121	70	23	a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment
3122	70	22	to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
3123	69	23	lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and
3124	25	8	argue the point with him.
3125	0	0	
3126	70	24	And just so I now did with Queequeg. "Queequeg," said I, "get into bed
3127	71	20	now, and lie and listen to me." I then went on, beginning with the rise
3128	71	23	and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
3129	66	21	religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
3130	72	22	Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in
3131	70	20	cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless
3132	67	21	for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and
3133	68	19	common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an
3134	72	25	extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained
3135	70	25	me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan
3136	68	21	of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the
3137	68	19	spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be
3138	72	19	half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish
3139	70	25	such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg,
3140	72	23	said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested
3141	65	20	apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary
3142	32	9	dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.
3143	0	0	
3144	63	21	I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
3145	69	21	dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
3146	70	25	in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great
3147	68	20	feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
3148	70	21	wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the
3149	54	18	afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.
3150	0	0	
3151	71	21	"No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;" for I knew the
3152	72	23	inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had
3153	69	18	visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when
3154	70	24	a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the
3155	68	19	yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed
3156	65	21	in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with
3157	69	22	breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were
3158	68	17	sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as
3159	53	14	though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.
3160	0	0	
3161	66	20	After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
3162	72	27	impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed
3163	69	20	dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his
3164	69	21	own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one
3165	71	19	third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he
3166	70	25	no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than
3167	63	19	I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and
3168	69	21	compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible
3169	66	21	young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.
3170	0	0	
3171	71	24	At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
3172	67	17	breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not
3173	70	23	make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the
3174	67	22	Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.

3181	71	21	As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
3182	71	23	carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
3183	70	19	from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
3184	72	21	and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
3185	45	14	unless they previously produced their papers.
3186	0	0	
3187	69	20	"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the
3188	55	14	bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
3189	0	0	
3190	48	13	"I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."
3191	0	0	
3192	70	21	"Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
3193	69	18	behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam. "He must show that he's converted.
3194	72	22	Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art thou at present in
3195	37	10	communion with any Christian church?"
3196	0	0	
3197	71	19	"Why," said I, "he's a member of the first Congregational Church." Here
3198	68	22	be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
3199	44	13	last come to be converted into the churches.
3200	0	0	
3201	68	17	"First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that worships in
3202	66	23	Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?" and so saying, taking
3203	64	19	out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
3204	65	19	handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
3205	71	21	wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
3206	9	5	Queequeg.
3207	0	0	
3208	72	19	"How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me; "not very
3209	33	9	long, I rather guess, young man."
3210	0	0	
3211	72	21	"No," said Peleg, "and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it would
3212	52	16	have washed some of that devil's blue off his face."
3213	0	0	
3214	69	20	"Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member of
3215	72	24	Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it
3216	18	4	every Lord's day."
3217	0	0	
3218	69	23	"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said
3219	67	21	I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
3220	60	21	Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."
3221	0	0	
3222	71	18	"Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with me--explain
3223	68	18	thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me."
3224	0	0	
3225	66	18	Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. "I mean, sir, the same
3226	68	21	ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
3227	68	22	and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of
3228	69	21	us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
3229	70	19	worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
3230	70	21	queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we all join
3231	7	1	hands."
3232	0	0	
3233	72	20	"Splice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer. "Young
3234	69	21	man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand;
3235	68	22	I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple
3236	72	22	himself couldn't beat it, and he's reckoned something. Come aboard, come
3237	69	21	aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there--what's
3238	71	19	that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what
3239	71	21	a harpoon he's got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it
3240	72	24	about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
3241	57	19	in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"
3242	0	0	
3243	69	22	Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
3244	65	19	the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
3245	68	19	hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
3246	46	14	harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--
3247	0	0	
3248	70	22	"Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
3249	67	20	spose him one whale eye, well, den!" and taking sharp aim at it, he
3250	68	19	darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across the
3251	62	14	ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
3252	0	0	
3253	71	25	"Now," said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, "spos-ee him whale-e
3254	26	7	eye; why, dad whale dead."
3255	0	0	
3256	66	18	"Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
3257	72	21	vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
3258	66	18	"Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers. We must have
3259	68	25	Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog,
3260	70	21	we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than ever was given a
3261	33	12	harpooneer yet out of Nantucket."
3262	0	0	
3263	69	22	So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
3264	66	18	enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.
3265	0	0	
3266	71	23	When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
3267	72	21	signing, he turned to me and said, "I guess, Quohog there don't know how
3268	70	20	to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or
3269	15	3	make thy mark?"
3270	0	0	
3271	68	24	But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
3272	66	22	part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
3273	65	21	offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
3274	71	25	counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
3275	72	24	that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative,
3276	31	9	it stood something like this:--
3277	0	0	
3278	19	5	Quohog. his X mark.
3279	0	0	
3280	71	25	Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
3281	67	18	and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
3282	67	20	broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting
3283	70	22	one entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose," placed it in
3284	68	18	Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
3285	72	21	looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, "Son of darkness, I must do my
3286	70	19	duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
3287	72	18	souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I
3288	71	23	sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn
3289	72	20	the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
3290	71	23	thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!"
3291	0	0	
3292	64	20	Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,
3293	59	19	heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.

3295	70	23	"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,"
3296	70	24	Peleg. "Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it takes the shark
3297	68	20	out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.
3298	67	23	There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all
3299	68	22	Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to
3300	70	21	good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and
3301	71	22	sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove
3302	24	6	and went to Davy Jones."
3303	0	0	
3304	71	18	"Peleg! Peleg!" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, "thou thyself,
3305	70	21	as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what
3306	69	20	it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou prate in this
3307	70	21	ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this
3308	72	23	same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan,
3309	71	22	that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did'st thou not
3310	38	9	think of Death and the Judgment then?"
3311	0	0	
3312	69	19	"Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
3313	69	17	thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--"hear him, all of ye.
3314	64	16	Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
3315	70	17	Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an
3316	72	24	everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us,
3317	72	19	fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think
3318	67	21	about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of;
3319	69	18	and how to save all hands--how to rig jury-masts--how to get into the
3320	47	12	nearest port; that was what I was thinking of."
3321	0	0	
3322	64	19	Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
3323	68	23	where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
3324	65	20	sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then
3325	68	20	he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
3326	33	11	otherwise might have been wasted.

3338	69	23	levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but
3339	68	20	shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
3340	71	19	black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all

3349	67	19	"Aye, the Pequod--that ship there," he said, drawing back his whole

3351	56	17	bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
3352	0	0	
3353	50	14	"Yes," said I, "we have just signed the articles."
3354	0	0	
3355	39	12	"Anything down there about your souls?"
3356	0	0	
3357	13	4	"About what?"
3358	0	0	
3359	70	18	"Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any," he said quickly. "No matter though,
3360	71	17	I know many chaps that hav'n't got any,--good luck to 'em; and they are
3361	72	21	all the better off for it. A soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon."
3362	0	0	
3363	49	17	"What are you jabbering about, shipmate?" said I.
3364	0	0	
3365	70	22	"HE'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort
3366	71	20	in other chaps," abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis
3367	17	5	upon the word HE.
3368	0	0	
3369	64	20	"Queequeg," said I, "let's go; this fellow has broken loose from
3370	68	20	somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know."
3371	0	0	
3372	70	18	"Stop!" cried the stranger. "Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen Old Thunder
3373	14	4	yet, have ye?"
3374	0	0	
3375	70	22	"Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness
3376	14	4	of his manner.
3377	0	0	
3378	15	5	"Captain Ahab."
3379	0	0	
3380	44	13	"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"
3381	0	0	
3382	65	20	"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye
3383	31	8	hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"
3384	0	0	
3385	71	16	"No, we hav'n't. He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
3386	29	9	all right again before long."
3387	0	0	
3388	68	19	"All right again before long!" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
3389	70	21	derisive sort of laugh. "Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
3390	53	14	this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."
3391	0	0	
3392	29	9	"What do you know about him?"
3393	0	0	
3394	45	12	"What did they TELL you about him? Say that!"
3395	0	0	
3396	71	18	"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that he's
3397	53	17	a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."
3398	0	0	
3399	72	19	"That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough. But you must jump when
3400	69	16	he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go--that's the word with
3401	72	22	Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape
3402	64	17	Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
3403	72	23	nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in
3404	71	22	Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver calabash
3405	63	19	he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
3406	71	20	according to the prophecy. Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and
3407	69	18	something more, eh? No, I don't think ye did; how could ye? Who knows
3408	71	20	it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell
3409	69	22	about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare
3410	72	20	say. Oh yes, THAT every one knows a'most--I mean they know he's only one
3411	47	14	leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off."
3412	0	0	
3413	66	19	"My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
3414	72	20	don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that you must be a
3415	71	25	little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of
3416	72	21	that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about
3417	21	5	the loss of his leg."
3418	0	0	
3419	38	12	"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?"
3420	0	0	
3421	14	3	"Pretty sure."
3422	0	0	
3423	67	22	With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
3424	69	22	stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
3425	68	19	little, turned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the
3426	72	16	papers? Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will be;
3427	70	19	and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all. Anyhow, it's all fixed
3428	67	21	and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I
3429	69	19	suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em! Morning to ye,
3430	71	20	shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I'm sorry I stopped
3431	4	1	ye."
3432	0	0	
3433	68	21	"Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell
3434	68	23	us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
3435	49	15	mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."
3436	0	0	
3437	69	19	"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
3438	72	21	you are just the man for him--the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
3439	71	21	morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded not to make one
3440	8	2	of 'em."
3441	0	0	
3442	70	20	"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way--you can't fool us. It
3443	72	23	is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great
3444	15	4	secret in him."
3445	0	0	
3446	36	9	"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."
3447	0	0	
3448	70	22	"Morning it is," said I. "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy
3449	44	12	man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?"
3450	0	0	
3451	9	3	"Elijah."
3452	0	0	
3453	66	20	Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
3454	68	21	other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
3455	65	19	nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone
3456	66	18	perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
3457	69	22	looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
3458	68	19	though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
3459	67	21	said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
3460	71	23	comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
3461	65	18	that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging
3462	69	21	us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
3463	71	22	circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
3464	69	20	shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
3465	70	21	and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain
3466	68	18	Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver
3467	70	20	calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
3468	72	23	the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage
3469	67	20	we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.
3470	0	0	
3471	70	20	I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
3472	70	20	dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,
3473	72	23	and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
3474	72	24	seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it
3475	53	17	seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.

3481	0	0	
3482	68	22	A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
3483	70	21	Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
3484	70	18	board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
3485	72	23	betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain
3486	72	22	Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
3487	68	20	look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing
3488	71	20	at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
3489	35	8	working till long after night-fall.
3490	0	0	
3491	71	22	On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given at
3492	70	17	all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their chests
3493	64	19	must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon
3494	66	21	the vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,
3495	68	20	resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they
3496	70	21	always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
3497	70	22	for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
3498	71	21	there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod
3499	19	6	was fully equipped.
3500	0	0	
3501	68	20	Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
3502	70	16	and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
3503	68	22	indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,
3504	67	25	which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean,
3505	70	17	far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And
3506	69	18	though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
3507	72	21	to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the
3508	72	26	whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the
3509	70	21	fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors
3510	69	20	usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling
3511	70	21	vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially
3512	72	19	to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of
3513	71	20	the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare
3514	70	21	lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain
3515	19	6	and duplicate ship.
3516	0	0	
3517	71	25	At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
3518	68	21	Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
3519	69	22	fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time
3520	71	21	there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
3521	37	8	ends of things, both large and small.
3522	0	0	
3523	64	18	Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
3524	71	23	Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
3525	69	20	spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if SHE
3526	72	22	could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once
3527	69	23	fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar
3528	72	19	of pickles for the steward's pantry; another time with a bunch of quills
3529	69	19	for the chief mate's desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a
3530	69	20	roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back. Never did
3531	70	20	any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as
3532	70	21	everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable
3533	68	20	Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand
3534	65	18	and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and
3535	63	20	consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
3536	70	20	Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
3537	19	5	well-saved dollars.
3538	0	0	
3539	70	22	But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
3540	70	20	board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and
3541	69	19	a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
3542	71	22	Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him
3543	68	20	a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
3544	67	22	went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a
3545	70	23	while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
3546	72	19	down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then
3547	42	12	concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.
3548	0	0	
3549	66	24	During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
3550	72	22	craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when
3551	69	22	he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would
3552	70	20	answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard
3553	69	21	every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend
3554	71	22	to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been
3555	72	19	downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart
3556	71	20	that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,
3557	65	21	without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute
3558	65	23	dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.
3559	69	19	But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be
3560	69	21	already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his
3561	70	20	suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I said
3562	36	9	nothing, and tried to think nothing.
3563	0	0	
3564	63	19	At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
3565	72	23	certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.

3572	70	17	It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
3573	20	4	drew nigh the wharf.
3574	0	0	
3575	71	25	"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I to
3576	72	21	Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess; come on!"
3577	0	0	
3578	72	24	"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
3579	69	22	us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself
3580	71	22	between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,
3581	53	18	strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
3582	0	0	
3583	15	5	"Going aboard?"
3584	0	0	
3585	30	8	"Hands off, will you," said I.

3587	57	19	"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"
3588	0	0	
3589	27	8	"Ain't going aboard, then?"
3590	0	0	
3591	72	21	"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours? Do you know,
3592	54	17	Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"
3593	0	0	
3594	61	17	"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and
3595	68	23	wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
3596	8	2	glances.
3597	0	0	
3598	70	20	"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We
3599	70	24	are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
3600	10	4	detained."

3602	44	13	"Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?"

3604	44	14	"He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."
3605	0	0	
3606	71	24	"Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
3607	6	2	paces.
3608	0	0	
3609	46	15	"Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."
3610	0	0	
3611	65	18	But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
3612	72	22	shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
3613	18	6	ship a while ago?"
3614	0	0	
3615	71	19	Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, "Yes,
3616	69	23	I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure."
3617	0	0	
3618	51	13	"Very dim, very dim," said Elijah. "Morning to ye."
3619	0	0	
3620	68	22	Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
3621	72	22	touching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find 'em now, will ye?
3622	0	0	
3623	11	2	"Find who?"
3624	0	0	
3625	69	21	"Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off. "Oh! I
3626	71	20	was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all one,
3627	71	19	all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it? Good-bye to
3628	72	22	ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's before the Grand
3629	72	19	Jury." And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for
3630	60	17	the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
3631	0	0	
3632	70	21	At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
3633	67	21	quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
3634	70	20	hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward
3635	67	22	to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a
3636	69	18	light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
3637	71	19	tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
3638	71	20	face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber
3639	15	4	slept upon him.
3640	0	0	
3641	70	24	"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said I,
3642	72	22	looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,
3643	68	24	Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would
3644	67	21	have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,
3645	72	26	were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the
3646	71	23	thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg
3647	71	18	that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish
3648	71	20	himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though
3649	70	23	feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly
3650	11	3	down there.
3651	0	0	
3652	46	16	"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.
3653	0	0	
3654	69	19	"Oh! perry dood seat," said Queequeg, "my country way; won't hurt him
3655	6	2	face."
3656	0	0	
3657	70	21	"Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
3658	70	22	but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you
3659	71	23	are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,
3660	51	14	he'll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't wake."
3661	0	0	
3662	68	23	Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
3663	70	21	lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
3664	72	25	over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him
3665	66	22	in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
3666	71	20	land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
3667	72	23	chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some
3668	71	22	of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in
3669	71	19	that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay
3670	71	22	them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on
3671	72	22	an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible
3672	70	21	into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
3673	72	24	desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps
3674	26	7	in some damp marshy place.

3676	71	25	While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
3677	70	22	from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head.

3683	69	23	He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
3684	71	22	which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
3685	69	20	his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
3686	66	19	strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began
3687	69	20	to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
3688	71	22	troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
3689	16	5	rubbed his eyes.
3690	0	0	
3691	51	14	"Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"

3693	48	13	"Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"
3694	0	0	
3695	68	22	"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
3696	24	7	came aboard last night."

3698	22	6	"What Captain?--Ahab?"

3702	70	22	I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
3703	22	8	heard a noise on deck.
3704	0	0	
3705	71	20	"Holloa! Starbuck's astir," said the rigger. "He's a lively chief mate,
3706	71	21	that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to." And so
3707	40	11	saying he went on deck, and we followed.
3708	0	0	
3709	65	20	It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
3710	65	19	threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
3711	70	24	engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
3712	63	21	last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly
3713	27	8	enshrined within his cabin.

3720	72	19	At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers,
3721	70	22	and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
3722	67	20	ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last
3723	71	18	gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a
3724	68	19	spare Bible for the steward--after all this, the two Captains, Peleg
3725	71	21	and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg
3726	5	2	said:
3727	0	0	
3728	69	20	"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is
3729	68	19	all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
3730	60	13	Well, call all hands, then. Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"
3731	0	0	
3732	72	21	"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said Bildad,
3733	58	16	"but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding."
3734	0	0	
3735	69	21	How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
3736	62	19	Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
3737	68	21	quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as
3738	72	22	well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of
3739	70	19	him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,
3740	72	21	the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the
3741	71	22	ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was
3742	66	18	not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not
3743	70	23	yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed
3744	72	23	below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant
3745	70	22	service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable
3746	66	22	time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,
3747	68	20	having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they
3748	38	11	quit the ship for good with the pilot.
3749	0	0	
3750	67	19	But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
3751	64	20	Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and
3752	27	7	commanding, and not Bildad.
3753	0	0	
3754	70	21	"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered at
3755	44	10	the main-mast. "Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft."
3756	0	0	
3757	70	19	"Strike the tent there!"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this
3758	68	22	whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
3759	72	19	Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
3760	43	12	be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
3761	0	0	
3762	71	16	"Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command, and
3763	35	8	the crew sprang for the handspikes.
3764	0	0	
3765	71	22	Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
3766	72	19	is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it
3767	72	23	known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
3768	67	21	of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
3769	71	22	order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
3770	66	18	in, for he never piloted any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now
3771	69	23	be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching
3772	72	21	anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,
3773	65	18	to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of
3774	64	20	a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.
3775	67	19	Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no
3776	67	22	profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in
3777	71	20	getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
3778	37	10	copy of Watts in each seaman's berth.
3779	0	0	
3780	69	23	Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
3781	72	20	and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would
3782	71	23	sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused
3783	66	20	on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the
3784	69	20	perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a
3785	71	20	pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious
3786	68	21	Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and
3787	68	18	seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and
3788	70	24	turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the
3789	72	19	act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first
3790	5	1	kick.
3791	0	0	
3792	64	19	"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared.
3793	70	16	"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don't ye
3794	72	17	spring, I say, all of ye--spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
3795	71	15	whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
3796	66	19	say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!" And so saying, he moved
3797	67	19	along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
3798	66	18	imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,
3799	55	17	Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
3800	0	0	
3801	68	19	At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It
3802	70	17	was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
3803	67	21	night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
3804	70	21	freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of
3805	68	20	teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
3806	69	21	ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
3807	9	2	the bows.
3808	0	0	
3809	72	20	Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
3810	70	20	old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost
3811	68	18	all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady
3812	19	6	notes were heard,--
3813	0	0	
3814	71	19	"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living green.
3815	62	19	So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between."

3818	68	19	Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They
3819	72	22	were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the
3820	70	22	boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was
3821	68	21	yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads
3822	69	16	and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
3823	42	13	untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
3824	0	0	
3825	65	20	At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed
3826	68	22	no longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
3827	10	4	alongside.
3828	0	0	
3829	72	24	It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at
3830	67	20	this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;
3831	69	23	very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
3832	67	19	voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of
3833	71	21	his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate
3834	67	22	sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
3835	71	22	encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to
3836	71	21	a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,--poor old Bildad
3837	69	20	lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
3838	67	22	cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
3839	68	20	looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
3840	64	20	bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards
3841	64	20	the land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere
3842	67	21	and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
3843	71	19	convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
3844	68	21	for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
3845	57	15	"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can."
3846	0	0	
3847	69	22	As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
3848	71	20	his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
3849	72	22	came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck--now
3850	59	16	a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
3851	0	0	
3852	65	19	But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
3853	69	20	about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the
3854	66	20	main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!
3855	64	18	Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last. Luck to ye,
3856	68	14	Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye and
3857	68	20	good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot supper
3858	50	14	smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!"
3859	0	0	
3860	66	18	"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old
3861	68	21	Bildad, almost incoherently. "I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so
3862	68	22	that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all
3863	67	19	he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
3864	67	19	Be careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don't stave the boats needlessly,
3865	69	22	ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
3866	70	18	within the year. Don't forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind
3867	69	22	that cooper don't waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in
3868	72	18	the green locker! Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days, men; but don't
3869	72	22	miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's good gifts. Have an
3870	72	21	eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought.
3871	71	21	If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye,
3872	63	17	good-bye! Don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr.
3873	67	16	Starbuck; it'll spoil. Be careful with the butter--twenty cents the
3874	32	8	pound it was, and mind ye, if--"
3875	0	0	
3876	68	19	"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away!" and with that,
3877	62	19	Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
3878	0	0	
3879	67	19	Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
3880	66	18	screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
3881	71	22	three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
3882	9	3	Atlantic.

3889	67	19	Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
3890	47	15	mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
3891	0	0	
3892	71	19	When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
3893	68	22	bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
3894	71	22	helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
3895	67	20	the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years' dangerous
3896	61	19	voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
3897	70	21	tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest
3898	72	25	things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this
3899	70	19	six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say
3900	68	17	that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably
3901	72	21	drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port
3902	69	19	is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm
3903	72	20	blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. But in that gale,
3904	68	15	the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all
3905	72	23	hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make
3906	71	17	her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail
3907	69	18	off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would
3908	65	19	blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again;
3909	67	19	for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her
3910	14	5	bitterest foe!
3911	0	0	
3912	68	19	Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
3913	70	21	intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
3914	66	23	effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while
3915	65	19	the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
3916	27	9	treacherous, slavish shore?
3917	0	0	
3918	62	18	But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
3919	71	23	indefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
3920	67	22	than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!
3921	67	17	For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of
3922	64	20	the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart,
3923	65	17	O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy
3924	51	16	ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!

3931	70	24	As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
3932	69	22	and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
3933	70	25	landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I
3934	72	23	am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done
3935	24	7	to us hunters of whales.
3936	0	0	
3937	68	22	In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
3938	68	20	the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
3939	71	24	accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a
3940	69	25	stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
3941	69	22	it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
3942	69	24	he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
3943	65	18	of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm
3944	69	22	Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
3945	39	13	pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.
3946	0	0	
3947	64	21	Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
3948	70	21	whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
3949	71	21	butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
3950	69	21	are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is
3951	71	22	true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
3952	72	21	all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour. And
3953	72	23	as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall
3954	71	23	soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown,
3955	71	17	and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship
3956	65	19	at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even
3957	68	21	granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery
3958	72	25	decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
3959	72	20	battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies'
3960	71	24	plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit
3961	65	21	of the soldier's profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran
3962	67	20	who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the
3963	70	23	apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies the air
3964	70	22	over his head. For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared
3965	48	13	with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!
3966	0	0	
3967	61	17	But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
3968	64	21	unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
3969	72	20	adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round
3970	57	16	the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!
3971	0	0	
3972	65	18	But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
3973	48	16	scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.
3974	0	0	
3975	66	18	Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling
3976	70	20	fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit
3977	69	20	out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
3978	66	20	score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did
3979	71	21	Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
3980	67	15	upwards of L1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
3981	71	22	America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;
3982	67	20	sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
3983	69	15	thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
3984	70	20	at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our
3985	67	16	harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if
3986	43	13	there be not something puissant in whaling?

3988	37	11	But this is not the half; look again.

3990	71	22	I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
3991	68	22	point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
3992	72	24	years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in
3993	68	20	one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way
3994	71	22	and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
3995	67	24	continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may
3996	71	20	well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
3997	63	17	pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to
3998	70	21	catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past
3999	69	23	the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
4000	71	22	least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes
4001	66	21	which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If
4002	67	26	American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
4003	61	18	harbors, let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the
4004	71	19	whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
4005	72	22	between them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes
4006	71	22	of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that
4007	68	24	scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were
4008	71	22	as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern. For in their
4009	69	19	succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,
4010	70	20	and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin
4011	68	19	wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would
4012	72	21	not willingly have dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the old
4013	70	23	South Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces of
4014	68	24	our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates
4015	72	21	three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the
4016	48	10	ship's common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!

4018	68	22	Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
4019	72	26	scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and
4020	68	21	the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast.
4021	69	21	It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the
4022	67	20	Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it
4023	72	20	might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the
4024	70	24	liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and
4025	58	17	the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
4026	0	0	
4027	72	25	That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given
4028	70	18	to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born
4029	66	17	discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores
4030	65	21	as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The
4031	66	19	whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover,
4032	69	21	in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were
4033	68	22	several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the
4034	68	20	whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted
4035	71	23	isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage
4036	66	19	to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the
4037	71	24	merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their
4038	72	23	first destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become
4039	70	22	hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due;
4040	36	10	for already she is on the threshold.

4042	70	20	But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
4043	70	24	aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
4044	71	21	shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
4045	11	4	every time.

4052	71	21	the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than
4053	71	18	Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from
4054	72	24	Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our
4055	52	16	glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!

4062	61	17	afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers
4063	62	18	of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
4064	69	20	harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the
4065	52	16	barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.

4109	68	21	In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
4110	68	20	substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
4111	62	18	should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might
4112	65	22	tell eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be
4113	12	3	blameworthy?
4114	0	0	
4115	72	22	It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern
4116	72	25	ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
4117	66	20	gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there
4118	70	19	may be a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely--who knows?
4119	66	21	Certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his
4120	65	21	coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they
4121	69	23	anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint
4122	65	20	machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential
4123	67	22	dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but
4124	67	19	meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably
4125	67	21	smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil,
4126	66	18	unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him
4127	70	23	somewhere. As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.
4128	0	0	
4129	70	20	But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil is
4130	72	26	used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil,
4131	70	22	nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What
4132	72	22	then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted
4133	32	10	state, the sweetest of all oils?
4134	0	0	
4135	66	17	Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and

4143	71	23	The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
4144	72	20	Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
4145	72	23	coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
4146	71	23	as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would
4147	66	22	not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of
4148	68	21	general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
4149	69	21	his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
4150	68	19	summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his
4151	72	24	thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and
4152	72	22	cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely
4153	70	22	the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the
4154	71	18	contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped
4155	72	22	up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified
4156	72	23	Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come,
4157	70	21	and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like
4158	68	22	a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well
4159	71	25	in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet
4160	71	21	lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted
4161	72	21	through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a
4162	71	22	telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for
4163	66	23	all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities
4164	69	21	in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to
4165	68	23	overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and
4166	71	24	endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his
4167	68	21	life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that
4168	65	22	sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to
4169	72	21	spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents
4170	72	20	and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the
4171	69	23	welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories
4172	70	19	of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the
4173	70	22	original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those
4174	70	21	latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush
4175	69	23	of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous
4176	66	20	vicissitudes of the fishery. "I will have no man in my boat," said
4177	69	20	Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale." By this, he seemed to mean,
4178	72	23	not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises
4179	70	23	from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly
4180	59	20	fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
4181	0	0	
4182	72	21	"Aye, aye," said Stubb, the second mate, "Starbuck, there, is as careful
4183	69	19	a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery." But we shall ere long
4184	68	20	see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a man like
4185	40	11	Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
4186	0	0	
4187	63	20	Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
4188	72	20	sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all
4189	72	20	mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this
4190	67	23	business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of
4191	70	20	the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.
4192	69	20	Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor
4193	69	19	for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting
4194	68	20	him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill
4195	71	17	whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that
4196	68	18	hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was
4197	72	19	his own father's? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn
4198	21	5	limbs of his brother?
4199	0	0	
4200	66	23	With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
4201	71	23	superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
4202	71	22	could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But
4203	70	23	it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
4204	69	23	terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature
4205	67	20	that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
4206	66	20	him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
4207	70	21	confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it
4208	70	19	was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
4209	68	19	while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
4210	67	20	whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
4211	69	23	cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
4212	72	23	which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and
4213	11	2	mighty man.
4214	0	0	
4215	69	23	But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
4216	72	23	abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to
4217	67	19	write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
4218	64	21	the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
4219	71	21	stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
4220	70	23	men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble
4221	66	18	and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
4222	68	21	ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
4223	68	23	costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves,
4224	71	22	so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
4225	67	22	seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of
4226	67	20	a valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
4227	72	20	completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this
4228	69	20	august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but
4229	72	23	that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it
4230	72	21	shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic
4231	72	19	dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The
4232	70	22	great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His
4233	34	14	omnipresence, our divine equality!
4234	0	0	
4235	67	20	If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
4236	70	24	hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
4237	72	21	graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them
4238	72	20	all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch
4239	72	21	that workman's arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow
4240	68	21	over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear
4241	71	23	me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal
4242	66	21	mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great
4243	70	19	democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the
4244	69	22	pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves
4245	71	21	of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who
4246	72	18	didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a
4247	71	19	war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all
4248	72	16	Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from
4249	45	13	the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!

4256	66	20	Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
4257	70	21	according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
4258	62	19	neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
4259	69	22	indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
4260	70	24	chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
4261	68	22	for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
4262	69	22	whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
4263	67	22	crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable
4264	72	23	arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the
4265	71	19	snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of
4266	69	18	the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as
4267	70	21	a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes
4268	72	20	while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had,
4269	71	20	for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he
4270	72	21	thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of
4271	70	21	it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his
4272	71	23	mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,
4273	72	21	he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
4274	72	23	themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed
4275	26	8	the order, and not sooner.
4276	0	0	
4277	64	16	What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
4278	68	21	unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
4279	70	18	world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
4280	70	22	what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that
4281	67	18	thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black
4282	66	24	little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would
4283	68	22	almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
4284	66	22	nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready
4285	72	21	loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he
4286	66	20	turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
4287	69	21	the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in
4288	69	19	readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
4289	55	16	legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.
4290	0	0	
4291	71	24	I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
4292	72	23	peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
4293	68	23	ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of
4294	71	22	the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the
4295	70	25	cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
4296	70	22	mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco
4297	58	19	smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.

4299	70	20	The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard. A
4300	68	19	short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
4301	68	21	who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
4302	71	23	and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
4303	70	21	honour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost
4304	71	22	was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
4305	69	20	bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
4306	69	22	any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,
4307	68	24	the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
4308	63	20	water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
4309	63	21	application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This
4310	70	23	ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
4311	69	20	the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
4312	69	21	three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
4313	68	21	that length of time. As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought
4314	70	20	nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask
4315	69	18	was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
4316	71	22	called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
4317	72	20	be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic
4318	71	20	whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted
4319	70	22	into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those
4320	15	5	battering seas.

4322	65	18	Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
4323	69	20	men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
4324	66	19	Pequod's boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
4325	72	21	Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales,
4326	72	24	these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with
4327	70	21	their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers;
4328	50	17	even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
4329	0	0	
4330	70	23	And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
4331	71	23	Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
4332	65	19	who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when
4333	69	21	the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
4334	71	23	moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
4335	69	21	and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
4336	68	22	down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
4337	14	4	them belonged.
4338	0	0	
4339	70	21	First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
4340	46	16	for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
4341	0	0	
4342	69	20	Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
4343	66	18	promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last
4344	72	21	remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring
4345	68	20	island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the
4346	71	21	fishery, they usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego's
4347	64	18	long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding
4348	72	24	eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their
4349	72	23	glittering expression--all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor
4350	69	23	of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest
4351	72	23	of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal
4352	68	19	forests of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild
4353	68	21	beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great
4354	70	21	whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the
4355	70	21	infallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe
4356	72	23	snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
4357	68	23	the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son
4358	69	20	of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second
4359	14	5	mate's squire.
4360	0	0	
4361	62	20	Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
4362	71	25	negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended
4363	69	21	from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
4364	68	18	them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
4365	71	22	them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
4366	64	20	lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been
4367	69	20	anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors
4368	71	19	most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
4369	69	20	life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
4370	69	22	manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
4371	68	21	and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
4372	71	24	feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at
4373	68	22	him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
4374	72	25	beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus
4375	67	21	Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man
4376	72	23	beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said, that
4377	69	21	at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
4378	71	23	mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born, though
4379	66	20	pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with the
4380	65	21	American whale fishery as with the American army and military and
4381	72	23	merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction
4382	69	24	of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all
4383	71	23	these cases the native American liberally provides the brains, the rest
4384	68	18	of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of
4385	66	22	these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound
4386	72	20	Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy
4387	69	20	peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers
4388	65	19	sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to
4389	70	22	receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards,
4390	63	18	they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but
4391	72	22	Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders
4392	71	23	in the Pequod, ISOLATOES too, I call such, not acknowledging the common
4393	72	25	continent of men, but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his
4394	72	25	own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!
4395	70	23	An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all
4396	69	21	the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the
4397	72	19	world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever
4398	71	20	come back. Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went before. Poor
4399	72	23	Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him,
4400	69	23	beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for,
4401	72	20	to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and
4402	72	25	beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!

4409	72	23	For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
4410	72	24	of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
4411	71	21	and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
4412	70	20	only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
4413	70	19	with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they
4414	67	21	but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was
4415	68	22	there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate
4416	41	13	into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.
4417	0	0	
4418	68	19	Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
4419	70	21	gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
4420	69	24	disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
4421	64	21	sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened
4422	67	23	at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
4423	71	24	recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived
4424	67	19	of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was
4425	69	23	almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
4426	66	20	prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
4427	68	22	uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
4428	69	21	about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
4429	70	21	emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
4430	68	21	were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
4431	70	23	tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
4432	71	20	acquainted with, still I ascribed this--and rightly ascribed it--to the
4433	71	26	fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation
4434	72	22	in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect
4435	66	18	of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most
4436	68	22	forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce
4437	69	22	confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three
4438	72	22	better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,
4439	72	24	could not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a
4440	71	21	Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the
4441	71	21	ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather,
4442	71	20	though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every
4443	69	24	degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that
4444	71	23	merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. It was one
4445	72	20	of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the
4446	72	20	transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water
4447	68	21	with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I
4448	67	21	mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I
4449	72	21	levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
4450	70	25	Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.
4451	0	0	
4452	67	21	There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
4453	69	21	recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
4454	71	20	the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
4455	69	22	or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His
4456	69	21	whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
4457	69	23	unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus. Threading its way out
4458	68	20	from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
4459	66	18	tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,
4460	67	19	you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
4461	65	20	perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of
4462	67	18	a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
4463	72	21	without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top
4464	72	22	to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly
4465	70	18	alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it
4466	70	21	was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.
4467	70	23	By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was
4468	71	22	made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego's senior, an old
4469	70	22	Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till
4470	65	18	he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and
4471	65	18	then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in
4472	68	22	an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially
4473	68	20	negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
4474	68	23	who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this
4475	66	22	laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the
4476	64	21	immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with
4477	70	23	preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously
4478	62	20	contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should
4479	62	17	be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he
4480	70	21	muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would
4481	44	11	find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
4482	0	0	
4483	72	21	So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid
4484	70	17	brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted
4485	72	22	that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
4486	71	21	white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that
4487	66	22	this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of
4488	70	19	the sperm whale's jaw. "Aye, he was dismasted off Japan," said the old
4489	71	22	Gay-Head Indian once; "but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
4490	57	18	mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of 'em."
4491	0	0	
4492	71	24	I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
4493	72	20	the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there
4494	66	21	was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank.
4495	70	23	His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a
4496	65	21	shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the
4497	70	20	ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude,
4498	69	23	a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
4499	67	20	forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
4500	64	19	officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures
4501	64	19	and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,
4502	70	22	consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,
4503	67	22	but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his
4504	71	23	face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.
4505	0	0	
4506	70	20	Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
4507	68	20	But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
4508	68	22	standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
4509	71	19	heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
4510	65	20	grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as
4511	67	18	if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
4512	70	18	bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
4513	69	20	came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,
4514	68	17	for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck,
4515	66	22	he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was
4516	69	20	only making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
4517	70	24	preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
4518	69	21	that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite
4519	70	20	Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
4520	72	24	layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the
4521	39	13	loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.
4522	0	0	
4523	64	19	Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
4524	72	23	pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from
4525	69	18	his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May,
4526	72	20	trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest,
4527	67	19	most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green
4528	68	20	sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the
4529	72	21	end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More
4530	69	19	than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any
4531	51	18	other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.

4537	0	0	
4538	66	21	Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
4539	67	17	went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
4540	72	22	perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic.
4541	71	19	The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days,
4542	70	20	were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up--flaked up, with
4543	71	20	rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
4544	70	21	jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
4545	68	20	absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man,
4546	72	20	'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights.
4547	71	21	But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new
4548	70	20	spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the
4549	71	21	soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory
4550	69	18	shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.
4551	67	21	And all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's
4552	8	3	texture.

4554	71	21	Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
4555	69	21	man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
4556	64	19	the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
4557	67	18	night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he
4558	71	22	seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
4559	68	19	were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. "It feels
4560	70	20	like going down into one's tomb,"--he would mutter to himself--"for an
4561	69	20	old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
4562	17	4	grave-dug berth."
4563	0	0	
4564	70	19	So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
4565	69	18	set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
4566	68	23	and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
4567	69	19	flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
4568	71	21	it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
4569	68	23	this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
4570	72	20	silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man
4571	70	20	would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.
4572	71	23	Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,
4573	69	23	he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his
4574	71	24	wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such
4575	71	20	would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that
4576	72	21	their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once,
4577	70	21	the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy,
4578	69	22	lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast,
4579	62	18	Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain
4580	68	23	unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was
4581	71	19	pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might
4582	69	20	be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and
4583	68	23	hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the
4584	53	14	ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.

4586	70	19	"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouldst wad me that
4587	67	16	fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;
4588	71	23	where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
4589	30	6	last.--Down, dog, and kennel!"
4590	0	0	
4591	67	21	Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
4592	72	19	scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, "I
4593	71	20	am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
4594	9	2	it, sir."
4595	0	0

4597	42	17	as if to avoid some passionate temptation.
4598	0	0	
4599	72	19	"No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely be called
4600	12	3	a dog, sir."

4602	71	21	"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,

4605	72	23	As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
4606	47	14	his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

4608	65	20	"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"
4609	71	19	muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. "It's
4610	70	18	very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know whether to go
4611	69	16	back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my knees and pray
4612	71	19	for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
4613	71	23	first time I ever DID pray. It's queer; very queer; and he's queer too;
4614	70	23	aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever
4615	68	20	sailed with. How he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans! is he
4616	67	19	mad? Anyway there's something on his mind, as sure as there must be
4617	72	21	something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more
4618	72	19	than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. Didn't
4619	70	18	that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds
4620	69	17	the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets
4621	66	19	down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the
4622	67	19	pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
4623	63	18	it? A hot old man! I guess he's got what some folks ashore call
4624	64	18	a conscience; it's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a
4625	68	18	toothache. Well, well; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me
4626	70	19	from catching it. He's full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the
4627	70	17	after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's
4628	68	19	that for, I should like to know? Who's made appointments with him in
4629	69	18	the hold? Ain't that queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old
4630	72	22	game--Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be
4631	71	18	born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think
4632	67	18	of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of
4633	72	22	queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But
4634	72	17	that's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and
4635	70	19	sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes again. But how's that?
4636	69	19	didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and
4637	69	20	piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT! He might as well have kicked
4638	68	19	me, and done with it. Maybe he DID kick me, and I didn't observe it,
4639	66	20	I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a
4640	71	18	bleached bone. What the devil's the matter with me? I don't stand right
4641	70	19	on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong
4642	67	19	side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How? how?
4643	68	19	how?--but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again;
4644	69	18	and in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by
4645	10	2	daylight."

4652	64	20	When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
4653	72	22	bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor
4654	71	20	of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.
4655	68	19	Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the
4656	44	13	weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

4658	67	20	In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
4659	72	23	fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one
4660	69	22	look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking
4661	72	19	him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of
4662	49	16	the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.

4664	70	20	Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
4665	70	19	in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. "How
4666	69	20	now," he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, "this smoking no
4667	68	17	longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
4668	70	25	gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring--aye, and
4669	67	17	ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
4670	72	19	such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the
4671	70	20	strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?
4672	70	20	This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapours
4673	70	20	among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I'll
4674	16	5	smoke no more--"
4675	0	0	
4676	69	21	He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
4677	68	18	waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
4678	58	15	made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.

4685	34	8	Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
4686	0	0	
4687	67	19	"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man's
4688	72	21	ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick
4689	71	16	back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then,
4690	71	22	presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking
4691	71	22	at it. But what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all
4692	71	23	dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
4693	70	17	thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
4694	70	15	kick from Ahab. 'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the row? It's not a real leg,
4695	67	20	only a false leg.' And there's a mighty difference between a living
4696	70	16	thump and a dead thump. That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask,
4697	67	21	fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living
4698	68	17	member--that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to
4699	70	18	myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against
4700	66	18	that cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all
4701	68	16	the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but
4702	64	19	a cane--a whalebone cane. Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful
4703	67	20	cudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base
4704	72	19	kick. Besides,' thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot
4705	71	21	part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer
4706	71	20	kicked me, THERE'S a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled
4707	61	18	down to a point only.' But now comes the greatest joke of the
4708	66	19	dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
4709	66	18	badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
4710	72	19	shoulders, and slews me round. 'What are you 'bout?' says he. Slid! man,
4711	71	20	but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over
4712	68	18	the fright. 'What am I about?' says I at last. 'And what business is
4713	72	19	that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do YOU want a kick?'
4714	71	19	By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his
4715	69	21	stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a
4716	67	17	clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern
4717	70	19	was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second
4718	72	19	thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,' said he,
4719	69	20	'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of
4720	70	20	his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying
4721	68	18	over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to
4722	69	19	kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it,
4723	66	17	when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!' 'Halloa,' says I, 'what's
4724	66	18	the matter now, old fellow?' 'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue
4725	67	17	the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says
4726	69	18	I--'right HERE it was.' 'Very good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg,
4727	69	14	didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb,
4728	69	19	what have you to complain of? Didn't he kick with right good will? it
4729	67	19	wasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were
4730	69	20	kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It's an
4731	71	22	honour; I consider it an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the
4732	70	20	greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made
4733	68	17	garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by
4734	72	21	old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; BE kicked by him;
4735	69	20	account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you can't
4736	69	18	help yourself, wise Stubb. Don't you see that pyramid?' With that, he
4737	71	25	all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into
4738	72	20	the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what
4739	35	9	do you think of that dream, Flask?"

4745	67	20	you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,

4762	71	22	Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost

4764	70	19	Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the
4765	68	22	leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
4766	66	24	indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more

4770	68	24	It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,

4788	71	20	Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
4789	65	20	those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
4790	69	21	knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
4791	68	21	some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are
4792	71	19	the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
4793	70	21	large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:--The Authors
4794	70	20	of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;
4795	72	22	Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
4796	72	24	Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;
4797	64	16	John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the
4798	71	21	Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what
4799	69	25	ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited
4800	19	4	extracts will show.
4801	0	0	
4802	69	21	Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
4803	67	22	ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
4804	65	23	harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate
4805	64	18	subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
4806	66	18	authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
4807	71	19	sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy
4808	71	23	mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper
4809	68	20	upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest
4810	69	19	of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
4811	68	20	profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
4812	68	20	then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
4813	69	20	this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
4814	71	23	and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference
4815	72	23	to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days,
4816	68	21	will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to
4817	69	20	them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new
4818	67	20	proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the
4819	64	19	Greenland whale is deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!
4820	0	0	
4821	72	21	There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
4822	68	23	sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
4823	70	21	succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale's and Bennett's; both in
4824	72	22	their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and
4825	70	23	reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found
4826	70	22	in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
4827	71	22	excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As
4828	71	22	yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete
4829	63	21	in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an
4830	15	5	unwritten life.
4831	0	0	
4832	59	21	Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
4833	65	24	comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
4834	68	20	present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
4835	66	20	laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
4836	65	22	hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;
4837	67	20	because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
4838	71	24	reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
4839	71	23	description of the various species, or--in this place at least--to much
4840	72	20	of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a
4841	65	21	systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.

4843	72	23	But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office
4844	68	22	is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them;
4845	69	22	to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very
4846	69	19	pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should
4847	68	22	essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job
4848	71	21	might well appal me. Will he the (leviathan) make a covenant with thee?
4849	69	22	Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and
4850	70	23	sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible
4851	71	23	hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to
4852	7	2	settle.
4853	0	0	
4854	69	22	First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
4855	71	21	is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
4856	70	21	still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of
4857	72	22	Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate the whales from
4858	70	16	the fish." But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,
4859	72	21	sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict,
4860	66	21	were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
4861	10	4	Leviathan.
4862	0	0	
4863	72	23	The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from
4864	69	21	the waters, he states as follows: "On account of their warm bilocular
4865	67	21	heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
4866	71	23	intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and finally, "ex lege naturae jure
4867	71	22	meritoque." I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
4868	69	22	Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
4869	69	23	they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
4870	56	17	insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
4871	0	0	
4872	69	22	Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
4873	69	19	ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
4874	67	18	This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
4875	72	23	respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given
4876	68	20	you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;

4879	68	20	Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
4880	69	21	conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
4881	63	22	whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have
4882	66	21	him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
4883	70	23	meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
4884	70	24	fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is
4885	70	20	still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have
4886	69	21	noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
4887	69	21	vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
4888	66	22	though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
4889	9	4	position.
4890	0	0	
4891	68	23	By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
4892	69	26	from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
4893	67	18	with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
4894	72	23	hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*
4895	68	20	Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be
4896	67	18	included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand
4897	35	12	divisions of the entire whale host.

4902	72	21	by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,
4903	72	20	contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
4904	70	21	wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials
4905	67	19	as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the
4906	20	6	Kingdom of Cetology.

4922	65	18	BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the
4923	66	18	English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
4924	65	20	whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
4925	70	18	French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the
4926	70	20	Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
4927	68	21	the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
4928	66	18	aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being
4929	68	21	the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
4930	71	24	obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
4931	71	22	upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically
4932	70	22	considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was
4933	71	21	almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
4934	68	19	was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
4935	70	23	spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
4936	70	22	creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland
4937	72	22	or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that
4938	67	19	quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of
4939	66	20	the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was
4940	69	20	exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
4941	72	21	and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays
4942	69	23	buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the
4943	67	23	true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still
4944	69	24	retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so
4945	69	20	strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at
4946	71	22	last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
4947	19	6	was really derived.

4949	71	21	BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is the
4950	70	22	most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
4951	72	21	by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and
4952	72	24	the oil specially known as "whale oil," an inferior article in commerce.
4953	65	20	Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the
4954	66	18	following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale;
4955	68	21	the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of
4956	69	22	obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously
4957	71	21	baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species
4958	72	21	of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the
4959	69	24	Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the
4960	69	18	French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale
4961	71	19	which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and
4962	72	22	English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen
4963	71	22	have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor'
4964	68	19	West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them
4965	29	8	Right Whale Cruising Grounds.

4967	67	23	Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
4968	70	21	English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree
4969	70	22	in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
4970	69	22	determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
4971	71	23	endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
4972	72	23	some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The
4973	71	22	right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference
4974	31	10	to elucidating the sperm whale.

4976	67	21	BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon
4977	66	18	a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
4978	70	21	Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
4979	65	18	whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
4980	70	18	Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and
4981	71	20	in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
4982	72	21	portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips
4983	72	19	present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
4984	72	20	of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
4985	68	23	he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some
4986	71	20	three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the
4987	69	20	back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if
4988	70	22	not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated
4989	69	19	fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When
4990	71	19	the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples,
4991	70	18	and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled
4992	70	21	surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it
4993	71	21	somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on
4994	69	20	it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not
4995	68	23	gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very
4996	69	20	shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the
4997	66	17	remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet
4998	70	22	rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with
4999	68	19	such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present
5000	69	23	pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable
5001	69	19	Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From
5002	71	22	having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with
5003	72	25	the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,
5004	71	22	that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there
5005	70	24	would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little
5006	72	22	known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched
5007	68	20	whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen's
5008	22	6	names for a few sorts.
5009	0	0	
5010	67	22	In connection with this appellative of "Whalebone whales," it is of
5011	68	23	great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
5012	70	24	convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
5013	72	26	in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon
5014	72	21	either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those
5015	69	23	marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford
5016	66	20	the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached
5017	65	16	bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How
5018	67	18	then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
5019	71	25	peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
5020	72	23	without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other
5021	72	21	and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked
5022	72	23	whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same
5023	67	21	humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen;
5024	71	24	but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the
5025	71	22	other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such
5026	68	23	irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,
5027	59	20	such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general
5028	69	23	methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the
5029	28	8	whale-naturalists has split.
5030	0	0	
5031	67	19	But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
5032	67	20	whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
5033	67	19	right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
5034	68	21	Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have
5035	66	19	seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
5036	66	22	Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various
5037	71	21	leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
5038	72	27	available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.
5039	68	19	What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in
5040	71	20	their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is
5041	72	22	the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can
5042	58	19	possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.

5044	69	20	BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on
5045	71	22	the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and
5046	68	22	towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you
5047	70	20	might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular
5048	67	20	name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm
5049	63	20	whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very
5050	69	23	valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
5051	71	21	all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
5052	14	4	other of them.

5056	69	21	nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he
5057	71	18	has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long
5058	68	19	sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody

5064	67	23	at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas,
5065	71	23	and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is
5066	70	23	never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are
5067	71	22	told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true

5086	67	21	loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb
5087	66	19	to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
5088	72	20	popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive
5089	72	25	features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one.
5090	71	24	He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet
5091	71	20	in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in
5092	70	22	herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in
5093	70	19	quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is
5094	64	20	regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.

5096	64	20	BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular
5097	70	19	fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
5098	67	22	Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so,
5099	69	19	and suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,
5100	71	21	because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the
5101	68	20	Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
5102	69	20	circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
5103	67	22	carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
5104	71	25	averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
5105	69	23	all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
5106	67	20	in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
5107	72	22	profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
5108	69	21	whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as
5109	71	25	some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
5110	69	22	themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their
5111	68	20	blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
5112	22	6	thirty gallons of oil.
5113	0	0	
5114	60	19	BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL
5115	71	25	WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose
5116	71	24	from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The
5117	69	24	creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
5118	71	23	feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly
5119	70	19	speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw
5120	64	20	in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only
5121	69	20	found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
5122	67	20	something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What
5123	69	21	precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
5124	69	21	say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
5125	71	20	bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for
5126	69	22	a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin
5127	68	22	said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the
5128	70	21	surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
5129	68	21	horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these
5130	70	22	surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided
5131	70	20	horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would
5132	70	21	certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
5133	72	22	The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and
5134	70	25	the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism
5135	68	23	to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain
5136	72	24	cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn
5137	66	23	was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison,
5138	67	21	and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also
5139	72	23	distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the
5140	69	23	horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it
5141	72	22	was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells
5142	65	18	me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when
5143	68	20	Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
5144	71	20	of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; "when Sir
5145	71	20	Martin returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter, "on bended knees
5146	68	21	he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,
5147	70	20	which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor." An Irish
5148	70	24	author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise
5149	71	21	present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the
5150	15	6	unicorn nature.

5152	66	23	The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
5153	70	19	milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
5154	72	23	His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and
5155	64	19	he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

5159	68	22	naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say
5160	72	22	that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage--a sort of
5161	70	23	Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
5162	72	21	hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The
5163	72	23	Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception
5164	66	20	might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground
5165	66	19	of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea;

5171	71	20	flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
5172	69	16	process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both
5173	38	13	are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

5180	68	19	To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
5181	70	21	possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
5182	69	20	feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the popular
5183	64	21	sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set
5184	67	21	down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
5185	70	24	definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal
5186	5	2	tail.

5188	64	21	BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
5189	70	22	common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
5190	70	23	bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
5191	68	21	must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always
5192	64	21	swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing
5193	63	19	themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their
5194	72	23	appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine
5195	71	19	spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They
5196	67	22	are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a
5197	67	20	lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
5198	62	19	these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly
5199	64	20	gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will
5200	70	26	yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid
5201	71	23	extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among
5202	66	21	jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise
5203	69	24	meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that
5204	68	21	a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
5205	72	22	readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
5206	61	20	you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.

5208	71	27	BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate. Very
5209	72	22	savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger
5210	72	23	than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him,
5211	69	20	and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but
5212	27	8	never yet saw him captured.

5214	66	25	BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
5215	72	22	largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is
5216	71	19	known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated,
5217	72	20	is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that
5218	71	22	he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs
5219	72	23	in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly
5220	70	24	girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has
5221	70	21	no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail,
5222	70	24	and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils
5223	69	21	all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable,
5224	66	18	yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called
5225	70	16	the "bright waist," that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two
5226	71	23	separate colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part
5227	70	21	of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he
5228	70	24	had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and
5229	63	20	mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.

5232	63	20	Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as
5233	67	22	the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the
5234	66	24	Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
5235	63	19	half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
5236	63	20	reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their
5237	69	22	fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
5238	69	23	future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If
5239	71	20	any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
5240	72	23	he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio,
5241	71	24	Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale;
5242	71	22	the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon
5243	68	19	Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the
5244	67	21	Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,
5245	72	22	Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of
5246	70	22	uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit
5247	68	19	them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for
5248	58	17	mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.

5250	67	18	Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
5251	68	22	here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have
5252	65	17	kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
5253	69	21	unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
5254	69	19	crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small
5255	69	20	erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true
5256	66	23	ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever
5257	67	18	completing anything. This whole book is but a draught--nay, but the
5258	61	16	draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!

5265	70	21	Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
5266	71	23	as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
5267	71	22	from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
5268	51	17	of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
5269	0	0	
5270	69	25	The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
5271	68	18	by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
5272	66	19	and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
5273	69	21	the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
5274	69	18	officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;
5275	66	26	usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In
5276	68	22	those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation
5277	66	21	and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
5278	68	19	department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer
5279	70	21	reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted
5280	69	22	title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but
5281	64	16	his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply
5282	67	23	as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more
5283	66	21	inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
5284	70	22	harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
5285	72	23	in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,
5286	71	20	but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the
5287	69	20	command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political
5288	66	20	maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from
5289	66	21	the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
5290	69	22	professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
5291	19	8	their social equal.
5292	0	0	
5293	67	20	Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
5294	70	17	this--the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
5295	70	22	merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
5296	70	24	so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
5297	72	20	the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the
5298	71	22	captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
5299	0	0	
5300	71	21	Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest
5301	71	22	of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
5302	71	21	the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
5303	70	21	or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
5304	67	20	common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
5305	72	20	hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
5306	66	20	rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
5307	68	23	how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
5308	65	21	primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
5309	71	23	externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
5310	69	22	and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
5311	71	22	which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
5312	66	19	grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost
5313	69	23	as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
5314	25	7	shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
5315	0	0	
5316	67	21	And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
5317	71	21	given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage
5318	65	24	he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he
5319	67	23	required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon
5320	69	22	the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
5321	64	21	circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
5322	63	20	addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or IN
5323	61	20	TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means
5324	57	19	unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.
5325	0	0	
5326	72	22	Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
5327	71	22	forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
5328	65	20	making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
5329	71	23	legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,
5330	67	24	which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through
5331	67	23	those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
5332	67	21	dictatorship. For be a man's intellectual superiority what it will,
5333	70	24	it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men,
5334	72	21	without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always,
5335	70	19	in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever
5336	69	18	keeps God's true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and
5337	67	21	leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who
5338	67	26	become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice
5339	64	20	hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted
5340	68	22	superiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks
5341	71	21	in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,
5342	72	25	that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted
5343	72	19	potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown
5344	70	25	of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian
5345	71	23	herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the
5346	71	22	tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest
5347	72	21	sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in
5348	35	11	his art, as the one now alluded to.

5350	64	19	But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
5351	66	20	grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
5352	64	19	Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
5353	71	22	whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
5354	69	21	and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
5355	71	20	must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
5356	29	12	featured in the unbodied air!

5363	72	21	It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
5364	61	18	face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and
5365	69	21	master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an
5366	71	23	observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the
5367	67	21	smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
5368	69	21	the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the
5369	70	21	tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But
5370	67	16	presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to
5371	67	20	the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, "Dinner, Mr.
5372	37	11	Starbuck," disappears into the cabin.
5373	0	0	
5374	72	19	When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the
5375	72	22	first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck
5376	72	22	rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after
5377	70	22	a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
5378	70	17	"Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges
5379	70	20	about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to
5380	70	21	see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise
5381	70	17	takes up the old burden, and with a rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows
5382	23	7	after his predecessors.
5383	0	0	
5384	69	21	But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
5385	68	23	seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
5386	70	18	sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
5387	71	22	shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
5388	70	18	over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
5389	68	20	his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
5390	69	21	far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
5391	70	20	processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into
5392	69	22	the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
5393	70	21	then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab's presence,
5394	43	13	in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.
5395	0	0	
5396	64	17	It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
5397	68	24	artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
5398	64	20	some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
5399	68	20	defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
5400	71	20	very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
5401	69	21	same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
5402	65	20	deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of
5403	69	22	the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
5404	68	20	difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of
5405	68	21	Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
5406	71	24	therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he
5407	69	20	who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
5408	69	21	private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's unchallenged power
5409	72	24	and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man's royalty of
5410	71	18	state transcends Belshazzar's, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who
5411	70	21	has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Caesar. It
5412	69	19	is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding. Now,
5413	65	24	if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
5414	66	20	ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
5415	39	15	peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
5416	0	0	
5417	61	22	Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned
5418	70	22	sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
5419	67	22	deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
5420	67	20	served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,
5421	70	22	there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,
5422	69	21	their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as he carved
5423	67	19	the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they
5424	68	21	would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
5425	69	23	upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his
5426	72	21	knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby
5427	68	22	motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as
5428	64	18	though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started
5429	64	19	if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it
5430	68	21	noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like
5431	72	23	the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly
5432	65	22	dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were
5433	71	24	somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab
5434	72	22	forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was
5435	72	20	to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And
5436	72	20	poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary
5437	71	22	family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have
5438	69	18	been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this
5439	70	22	must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had
5440	68	21	he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have
5441	65	19	been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
5442	69	19	strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,
5443	72	22	the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did
5444	70	19	Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners
5445	67	20	of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,
5446	72	22	sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
5447	69	21	marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for
5448	68	19	him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
5449	0	0	
5450	70	17	Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask
5451	66	16	is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was badly
5452	70	18	jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;
5453	70	22	and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb
5454	69	19	even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small
5455	70	18	appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask
5456	72	19	must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day;
5457	68	20	for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.
5458	72	23	Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he
5459	70	21	had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never
5460	69	18	known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what
5461	70	23	he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.
5462	66	21	Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from
5463	66	19	my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
5464	72	25	old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the
5465	71	19	mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:
5466	66	21	there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere
5467	67	22	sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official
5468	72	24	capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance,
5469	71	21	was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin

5472	71	20	Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
5473	70	23	in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted
5474	67	20	order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
5475	72	21	restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three
5476	72	25	harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.
5477	67	17	They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty
5478	6	2	cabin.
5479	0	0	
5480	67	19	In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
5481	71	25	invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire care-free
5482	72	24	license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
5483	69	23	the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
5484	72	23	sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
5485	72	20	with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;
5486	72	22	they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.
5487	69	24	Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out
5488	71	23	the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was
5489	70	23	fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of
5490	71	22	the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with
5491	69	19	a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
5492	70	21	accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once
5493	66	20	Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by
5494	66	18	snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
5495	68	21	wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
5496	68	20	circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,
5497	71	19	shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny
5498	68	19	of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing
5499	67	23	spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous
5500	66	23	visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one
5501	70	24	continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished
5502	71	20	with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into
5503	71	21	his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the
5504	38	10	blinds of its door, till all was over.
5505	0	0	
5506	69	26	It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
5507	72	23	his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the
5508	71	22	floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
5509	69	21	carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
5510	67	22	framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a
5511	67	19	ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
5512	71	20	not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
5513	72	22	small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
5514	68	21	baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed
5515	70	21	strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
5516	66	18	dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by
5517	70	25	beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a
5518	69	21	mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so
5519	66	19	much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether
5520	70	20	any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
5521	72	21	Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
5522	72	19	picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
5523	69	16	round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the
5524	67	21	whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
5525	68	18	lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they
5526	72	22	would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at
5527	72	22	all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his
5528	71	24	Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
5529	67	22	murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the
5530	70	22	white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on
5531	67	19	his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,
5532	68	22	the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,
5533	71	22	fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every
5534	42	12	step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
5535	0	0	
5536	68	21	But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
5537	69	19	there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
5538	71	23	scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
5539	59	18	when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
5540	0	0	
5541	67	24	In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
5542	69	20	captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
5543	71	19	the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
5544	70	20	anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,
5545	70	23	the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to
5546	70	21	have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it
5547	66	21	was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for
5548	68	19	a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
5549	69	21	residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
5550	71	23	was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally
5551	70	21	included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He
5552	68	18	lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled
5553	72	20	Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of
5554	72	22	the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter
5555	67	18	there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,
5556	71	20	Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the
5557	25	7	sullen paws of its gloom!

5564	70	23	It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
5565	43	13	other seamen my first mast-head came round.
5566	0	0	
5567	58	19	In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
5568	70	21	simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may
5569	70	24	have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
5570	67	22	cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage
5571	71	18	she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial
5572	72	19	even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
5573	71	22	skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
5574	48	17	relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
5575	0	0	
5576	72	22	Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
5577	67	26	ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here.
5578	64	20	I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
5579	68	21	Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.
5580	71	20	For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by
5581	70	24	their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,
5582	71	22	or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
5583	72	22	stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread
5584	67	21	gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders
5585	68	22	priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of
5586	71	24	mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among
5587	69	22	archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical
5588	66	21	purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like
5589	71	25	formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious
5590	71	21	long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount
5591	67	21	to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a
5592	69	21	modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In
5593	71	21	Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him
5594	72	21	a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of
5595	64	19	his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a
5596	59	20	tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
5597	70	18	stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs
5598	71	21	or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to
5599	70	19	the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads
5600	66	20	we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,
5601	66	21	though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely
5602	71	23	incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange
5603	69	21	sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome,
5604	68	19	stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;
5605	71	22	careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis
5606	70	20	Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on
5607	71	23	his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars,
5608	70	19	his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
5609	68	19	will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
5610	66	19	mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that
5611	65	20	London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for
5612	69	21	where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor
5613	67	21	Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however
5614	64	18	madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks
5615	68	20	upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits
5616	70	20	penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals
5617	31	7	and what rocks must be shunned.
5618	0	0	
5619	64	21	It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
5620	67	18	standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is
5621	67	19	not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
5622	69	20	historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,
5623	70	21	that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
5624	72	23	launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty
5625	67	20	spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means
5626	70	23	of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few
5627	72	22	years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand,
5628	72	22	who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh
5629	71	21	the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the
5630	71	22	one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads
5631	65	20	are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their
5632	66	20	regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two
5633	70	23	hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant
5634	70	22	the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There
5635	68	20	you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the
5636	65	20	deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and
5637	72	22	between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even
5638	68	23	as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old
5639	69	22	Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with
5640	69	17	nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the
5641	70	20	drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the
5642	72	21	most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests
5643	71	22	you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts
5644	71	26	of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear
5645	68	21	of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are
5646	70	20	never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--for
5647	71	21	all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and
5648	31	11	your bill of fare is immutable.

5650	66	22	In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'
5651	71	23	voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
5652	69	22	mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be
5653	69	24	deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
5654	68	22	of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute
5655	71	24	of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
5656	71	22	comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
5657	70	21	a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
5658	71	22	and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your
5659	71	21	most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you
5660	72	21	stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called
5661	71	20	the t' gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner
5662	71	21	feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure,
5663	72	24	in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of
5664	70	20	a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more
5665	71	23	of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its
5666	72	24	fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out
5667	72	22	of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim
5668	69	18	crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of
5669	70	28	a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You
5670	72	21	cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you
5671	44	15	make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.
5672	0	0	
5673	71	20	Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
5674	67	22	southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
5675	70	19	or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a Greenland
5676	70	22	whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In
5677	69	25	the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled "A Voyage among the
5678	67	20	Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
5679	65	21	re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;" in
5680	68	21	this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with
5681	65	19	a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
5682	70	20	CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet's good
5683	69	18	craft. He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in honour of himself; he
5684	70	25	being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
5685	70	21	false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our
5686	69	22	own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so
5687	68	26	likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we
5688	70	20	may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large
5689	69	24	tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with
5690	70	24	a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.
5691	67	21	Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a
5692	68	19	little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the
5693	70	21	stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for
5694	70	19	umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which
5695	66	23	to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical
5696	70	22	conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this
5697	67	17	crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him
5698	68	18	(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for
5699	71	21	the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns
5700	70	20	infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from
5701	69	21	the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon
5702	67	19	them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love
5703	66	22	for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed
5704	68	20	conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many
5705	69	22	of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his
5706	71	18	experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for
5707	69	21	the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
5708	70	22	the "local attraction" of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to
5709	68	19	the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the
5710	65	19	Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down
5711	66	17	blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very
5712	64	20	discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned "binnacle
5713	70	23	deviations," "azimuth compass observations," and "approximate errors,"
5714	67	18	he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed
5715	66	23	in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted
5716	72	22	occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely
5717	72	21	tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.
5718	69	22	Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the
5719	66	20	honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he
5720	72	23	should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend
5721	71	22	and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded
5722	68	19	head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
5723	41	13	within three or four perches of the pole.

5725	66	21	But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
5726	65	21	Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
5727	68	20	greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
5728	70	22	seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used
5729	69	22	to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
5730	69	21	chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;
5731	69	19	then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
5732	72	23	top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at
5733	38	13	last mount to my ultimate destination.

5735	72	21	Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but
5736	66	19	sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how
5737	70	20	could I--being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
5738	68	21	altitude--how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
5739	71	22	whale-ships' standing orders, "Keep your weather eye open, and sing out
5740	12	4	every time."
5741	0	0	
5742	65	19	And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
5743	70	23	Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
5744	71	25	lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
5745	71	22	offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware
5746	66	21	of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be
5747	67	20	killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes
5748	69	20	round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor
5749	68	23	are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery
5750	68	19	furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
5751	65	19	young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
5752	68	19	sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
5753	72	22	himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and
5754	29	10	in moody phrase ejaculates:--
5755	0	0	
5756	59	18	"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
5757	41	13	blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."
5758	0	0	
5759	65	19	Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
5760	71	22	young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
5761	71	20	"interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
5762	68	23	to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
5763	66	21	rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young
5764	65	22	Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are
5765	68	19	short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have
5766	33	11	left their opera-glasses at home.

5768	71	23	"Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've been
5769	68	22	cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
5770	65	20	yet. Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here."
5771	69	20	Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
5772	67	21	the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
5773	71	22	vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
5774	67	19	cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
5775	70	23	takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
5776	62	19	blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every
5777	67	20	strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
5778	71	22	dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him
5779	69	22	the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
5780	72	19	continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs
5781	69	23	away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like
5782	70	19	Crammer's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every
5783	27	9	shore the round globe over.
5784	0	0	
5785	69	21	There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
5786	68	16	gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
5787	72	21	the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye,
5788	72	22	move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity
5789	70	22	comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps,
5790	70	21	at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you
5791	70	22	drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise
5792	38	11	for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!

5802	63	21	It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
5803	68	18	morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
5804	71	21	cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that
5805	72	22	hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the
5806	7	2	garden.
5807	0	0	
5808	71	21	Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
5809	69	21	rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
5810	71	22	dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
5811	68	21	you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
5812	68	20	you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints of his one
5813	32	10	unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
5814	0	0	
5815	67	24	But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as
5816	69	19	his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his
5817	69	20	thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
5818	68	21	main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
5819	68	20	turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
5820	72	22	possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every
5821	15	6	outer movement.
5822	0	0	
5823	71	14	"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him pecks
5824	31	8	the shell. 'Twill soon be out."
5825	0	0	
5826	71	21	The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
5827	61	18	deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
5828	0	0	
5829	64	18	It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the
5830	72	22	bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with
5831	70	20	one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.
5832	0	0	
5833	69	22	"Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
5834	45	15	ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
5835	0	0	
5836	68	19	"Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab. "Mast-heads, there! come down!"
5837	0	0	
5838	71	21	When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not
5839	70	24	wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
5840	66	20	the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
5841	69	18	glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
5842	67	19	started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
5843	71	20	resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched
5844	69	22	hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
5845	70	20	the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have
5846	72	23	summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But
5847	55	14	this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:--
5848	0	0	
5849	41	12	"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"
5850	0	0	
5851	71	22	"Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
5852	7	3	voices.
5853	0	0	
5854	68	20	"Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
5855	71	25	hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
5856	12	2	thrown them.
5857	0	0	
5858	27	6	"And what do ye next, men?"
5859	0	0	
5860	28	8	"Lower away, and after him!"
5861	0	0	
5862	38	10	"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"
5863	0	0	
5864	31	11	"A dead whale or a stove boat!"
5865	0	0	
5866	65	18	More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
5867	67	22	countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began
5868	70	22	to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
5869	69	23	themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
5870	0	0	
5871	70	22	But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
5872	72	20	pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
5873	48	12	convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--
5874	0	0	
5875	71	25	"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
5876	67	20	whale. Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"--holding up a
5877	70	21	broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D'ye
5878	44	11	see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."
5879	0	0	
5880	66	20	While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
5881	69	19	slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
5882	65	20	to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile
5883	68	18	lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
5884	71	24	inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
5885	16	5	vitality in him.
5886	0	0	
5887	71	21	Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
5888	66	19	with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
5889	64	22	other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever of ye
5890	70	23	raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
5891	67	23	whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
5892	68	23	punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
5893	63	17	that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!"
5894	0	0	
5895	66	19	"Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
5896	47	14	hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
5897	0	0	
5898	72	21	"It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
5899	72	21	"a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
5900	34	11	if ye see but a bubble, sing out."
5901	0	0	
5902	69	24	All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
5903	68	21	more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
5904	68	19	of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
5905	49	17	separately touched by some specific recollection.
5906	0	0	
5907	70	21	"Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same that
5908	21	5	some call Moby Dick."
5909	0	0	
5910	67	17	"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab. "Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"
5911	0	0	
5912	71	24	"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said the
5913	24	9	Gay-Header deliberately.
5914	0	0	
5915	71	23	"And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very bushy, even for a
5916	44	12	parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"
5917	0	0	
5918	66	21	"And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
5919	69	23	Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
5920	70	17	him--him--" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
5921	53	15	round as though uncorking a bottle--"like him--him--"
5922	0	0	
5923	69	22	"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
5924	70	23	and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
5925	67	22	shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the
5926	67	23	great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
5927	69	19	split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have
5928	28	6	seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"
5929	0	0	
5930	70	17	"Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
5931	69	24	been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
5932	71	20	struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. "Captain
5933	71	20	Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick that took off
5934	9	1	thy leg?"
5935	0	0	
5936	71	19	"Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
5937	70	19	hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
5938	72	21	brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye," he shouted with
5939	66	22	a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
5940	71	24	"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor
5941	70	18	pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!" Then tossing both arms, with
5942	70	25	measureless imprecations he shouted out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him
5943	72	21	round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and
5944	71	23	round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have
5945	70	19	shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and
5946	70	20	over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.
5947	69	18	What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look
5948	7	2	brave."
5949	0	0	
5950	69	23	"Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
5951	68	20	excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
5952	11	2	Moby Dick!"
5953	0	0	
5954	68	17	"God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout. "God bless ye,
5955	69	18	men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what's this long
5956	70	20	face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
5957	20	5	game for Moby Dick?"
5958	0	0	
5959	70	22	"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
5960	68	21	Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
5961	72	20	came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. How many barrels
5962	71	23	will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it
5963	50	14	will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market."
5964	0	0	
5965	66	20	"Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest
5966	65	20	a little lower layer. If money's to be the measurer, man, and the
5967	66	22	accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
5968	72	21	girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
5969	65	19	me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!"
5970	0	0	
5971	69	15	"He smites his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it
5972	29	6	rings most vast, but hollow."
5973	0	0	
5974	68	19	"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee
5975	65	16	from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,
5976	33	11	Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."
5977	0	0	
5978	69	20	"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
5979	70	21	are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event--in the living act, the
5980	72	21	undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
5981	70	22	the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man
5982	72	21	will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside
5983	68	17	except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that
5984	69	20	wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there's naught beyond. But
5985	72	23	'tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,
5986	65	20	with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is
5987	72	22	chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
5988	72	20	principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,
5989	69	19	man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that,
5990	66	21	then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play
5991	70	22	herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man,
5992	71	20	is even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off
5993	62	20	thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish
5994	68	20	stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to
5995	67	18	anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing
5996	72	20	unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I
5997	72	23	meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of
5998	70	19	spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan
5999	70	19	leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek,
6000	69	20	and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the
6001	70	20	crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?
6002	67	19	See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it.
6003	65	19	Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot,
6004	70	18	Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. 'Tis but to help strike a fin; no
6005	69	20	wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor hunt,
6006	72	19	then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back,
6007	68	19	when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings
6008	70	23	seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye!
6009	67	18	thy silence, then, THAT voices thee. (ASIDE) Something shot from my
6010	71	20	dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine;
6011	41	14	cannot oppose me now, without rebellion."
6012	0	0	
6013	54	14	"God keep me!--keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.
6014	0	0	
6015	69	23	But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
6016	70	22	did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
6017	67	19	hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage;
6018	71	20	nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
6019	72	20	their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with
6020	69	21	the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds
6021	72	22	blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah,
6022	62	17	ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But
6023	68	19	rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much
6024	66	22	predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things
6025	63	18	within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost
6026	50	17	necessities in our being, these still drive us on.
6027	0	0	
6028	39	14	"The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.
6029	0	0	
6030	65	20	Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
6031	72	23	ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near
6032	70	20	the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates
6033	71	19	stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company
6034	68	20	formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly
6035	65	19	eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the
6036	70	26	bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere
6037	72	22	he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to
6038	41	13	fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.
6039	0	0	
6040	67	17	"Drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
6041	70	20	nearest seaman. "The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
6042	66	16	draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so; it
6043	61	19	goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
6044	71	19	serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
6045	69	20	way it comes. Hand it me--here's a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
6046	50	14	brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
6047	0	0	
6048	70	19	"Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and
6049	68	20	ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
6050	71	21	with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
6051	72	23	sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you
6052	72	21	will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand
6053	72	18	it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, were't not thou St.
6054	28	10	Vitus' imp--away, thou ague!
6055	0	0	
6056	68	20	"Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let
6057	64	18	me touch the axis." So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the
6058	70	22	three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
6059	71	18	suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
6060	68	17	Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some
6061	69	24	nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the
6062	72	25	same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic
6063	70	22	life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic
6064	67	19	aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of
6065	24	5	Starbuck fell downright.
6066	0	0	
6067	67	18	"In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well. For did ye three but
6068	71	19	once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT had
6069	69	22	perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye
6070	68	20	dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do
6071	70	22	appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there--yon three
6072	71	24	most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain
6073	69	19	the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using
6074	72	22	his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, THAT
6075	69	20	shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings
6076	36	11	and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"
6077	0	0	
6078	68	21	Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
6079	71	21	detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
6080	15	5	up, before him.
6081	0	0	
6082	69	17	"Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye
6083	68	18	not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,
6084	66	17	advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!" Forthwith,
6085	66	20	slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
6086	46	12	sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.
6087	0	0	
6088	70	20	"Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
6089	66	23	them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
6090	71	21	Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
6091	72	20	it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful
6092	71	19	whaleboat's bow--Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt
6093	68	18	Moby Dick to his death!" The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
6094	71	23	and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were
6095	72	21	simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and
6096	72	21	shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
6097	68	17	among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
6098	45	14	dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.

6112	70	18	Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
6113	72	19	The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun--slow dived from noon--goes
6114	69	18	down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,
6115	68	19	the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is
6116	71	19	it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
6117	72	18	darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. 'Tis iron--that
6118	69	18	I know--not gold. 'Tis split, too--that I feel; the jagged edge galls
6119	72	22	me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
6120	70	19	mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

6122	70	18	Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred

6124	69	22	all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with
6125	72	19	the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly
6126	71	20	and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night--good
6127	51	12	night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW.)

6129	71	19	'Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
6130	69	21	but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
6131	68	19	revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
6132	70	19	stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the
6133	69	19	match itself must needs be wasting! What I've dared, I've willed; and
6134	68	17	what I've willed, I'll do! They think me mad--Starbuck does; but I'm
6135	67	18	demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that's only calm
6136	68	19	to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;
6137	66	17	and--Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my
6138	68	18	dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That's
6139	66	21	more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye
6140	68	20	cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!
6141	69	23	I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies--Take some one of your own
6142	72	21	size; don't pommel ME! No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but
6143	71	21	YE have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags! I have
6144	69	21	no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see
6145	67	20	if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve
6146	72	21	yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is
6147	71	24	laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded
6148	69	19	gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds,
6149	70	20	unerringly I rush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to the iron

6162	72	22	he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see
6163	69	20	his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I,
6164	70	22	the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no
6165	72	21	knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who's over him, he cries;--aye, he would
6166	71	23	be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I
6167	68	21	plainly see my miserable office,--to obey, rebelling; and worse yet,
6168	71	24	to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would
6169	68	21	shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow wide.
6170	67	18	The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small
6171	69	19	gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may
6172	66	22	wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole

6184	65	18	through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering
6185	68	19	bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his
6186	69	21	sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake, and further
6187	70	15	on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through!
6188	70	21	Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! 'tis in an hour like
6189	68	19	this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,--as wild, untutored
6190	71	21	things are forced to feed--Oh, life! 'tis now that I do feel the latent

6207	68	18	will, one comfort's always left--that unfailing comfort is, it's all
6208	69	19	predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor
6209	71	23	eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
6210	68	19	the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the
6211	70	21	gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I clapped my eye upon
6212	67	14	his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, WISE Stubb--that's my title--well,
6213	70	18	Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here's a carcase. I know not all that may be
6214	70	19	coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
6215	68	20	leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,

6445	70	19	I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
6446	69	20	my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more
6447	67	20	did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A
6448	71	20	wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's quenchless feud
6449	69	23	seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous
6450	64	20	monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of
6451	21	8	violence and revenge.
6452	0	0	
6453	64	20	For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
6454	62	21	secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
6455	72	19	frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his
6456	69	20	existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him;
6457	70	20	while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to
6458	72	21	him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers;
6459	61	18	the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery
6460	67	21	circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along
6461	68	22	solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
6462	71	21	more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort;
6463	70	25	the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the
6464	71	21	times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct
6465	69	19	and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide
6466	68	22	whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby
6467	72	21	Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have
6468	67	22	encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian,
6469	69	21	a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after
6470	71	22	doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to
6471	69	21	some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in
6472	67	21	question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the
6473	65	20	Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
6474	63	19	instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
6475	70	21	attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
6476	67	16	battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
6477	68	22	content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to
6478	70	21	the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual
6479	69	22	cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and
6480	47	15	the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.
6481	0	0	
6482	70	21	And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
6483	72	20	caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
6484	72	19	them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
6485	72	23	whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these
6486	72	19	assaults--not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or
6487	70	24	devouring amputations--but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those
6488	71	24	repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors
6489	72	21	upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many
6490	72	21	brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.
6491	0	0	
6492	71	21	Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
6493	70	22	horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
6494	69	21	fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
6495	71	20	terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
6496	72	23	maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors abound,
6497	71	23	wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And as the
6498	69	20	sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses
6499	71	23	every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
6500	72	23	of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen
6501	71	24	as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
6502	65	18	to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most
6503	70	20	directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing
6504	69	21	in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but,
6505	70	20	hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that
6506	69	24	though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you
6507	72	24	would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath
6508	68	21	that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too
6509	68	20	such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all
6510	60	14	tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.
6511	0	0	
6512	70	21	No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
6513	68	20	the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did
6514	66	19	in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints,
6515	66	22	and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
6516	71	20	eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
6517	71	20	that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally
6518	70	19	strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White
6519	71	22	Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
6520	4	1	jaw.
6521	0	0	
6522	71	22	But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
6523	66	20	Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm
6524	63	20	Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
6525	69	23	leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are
6526	65	21	those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
6527	64	20	enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
6528	67	23	perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
6529	72	22	timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are
6530	70	22	plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing
6531	71	23	under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm
6532	65	21	Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to
6533	69	22	the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their
6534	65	20	hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest
6535	67	19	and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the
6536	65	21	pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more
6537	68	18	feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.
6538	0	0	
6539	59	17	And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former
6540	62	19	legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
6541	72	21	naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only to
6542	72	26	be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
6543	70	23	incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
6544	69	24	even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or almost similar
6545	66	20	impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself
6546	72	18	affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are
6547	72	18	"struck with the most lively terrors," and "often in the precipitancy of
6548	71	20	their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to
6549	70	26	cause instantaneous death." And however the general experiences in the
6550	72	20	fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness,
6551	70	24	even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in
6552	72	24	them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of
6553	12	3	the hunters.
6554	0	0	
6555	72	20	So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
6556	67	21	the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
6557	70	20	of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
6558	71	20	practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
6559	68	20	warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
6560	69	23	hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
6561	68	18	as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would
6562	71	24	be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are
6563	48	15	some remarkable documents that may be consulted.
6564	0	0	
6565	67	21	Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
6566	70	21	were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
6567	63	18	chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
6568	67	24	specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
6569	70	21	accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
6570	8	3	offered.
6571	0	0	
6572	71	22	One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
6573	66	20	with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,
6574	68	21	was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
6575	67	26	actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
6576	16	5	instant of time.
6577	0	0	
6578	72	22	Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
6579	72	24	without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
6580	65	21	of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to
6581	64	19	the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale
6582	68	23	when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his
6583	68	24	pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious and
6584	68	21	contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the
6585	68	18	mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports
6586	67	16	himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.
6587	0	0	
6588	70	19	It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
6589	71	23	as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,
6590	70	22	that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose
6591	68	22	bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland
6592	70	23	seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
6593	70	23	been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
6594	66	20	not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been
6595	72	21	believed by some whalemen, that the Nor' West Passage, so long a problem
6596	67	20	to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real
6597	70	24	living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of
6598	70	23	the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said
6599	69	20	to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);
6600	65	21	and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near
6601	68	22	Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land
6602	70	23	by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully
6603	42	15	equalled by the realities of the whalemen.
6604	0	0	
6605	72	22	Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
6606	67	22	that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped
6607	69	22	alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should
6608	69	19	go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only
6609	72	25	ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that
6610	71	19	though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still
6611	70	23	swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick
6612	66	20	blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in
6613	71	25	unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would
6614	18	7	once more be seen.
6615	0	0	
6616	71	23	But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
6617	69	21	the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
6618	64	20	the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his
6619	69	19	uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
6620	64	20	but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
6621	70	22	forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent
6622	71	22	features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
6623	65	20	revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
6624	0	0	
6625	67	17	The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with
6626	70	22	the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
6627	70	24	appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
6628	68	20	his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
6629	70	21	sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
6630	10	3	gleamings.
6631	0	0	
6632	70	22	Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
6633	72	21	deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
6634	70	21	as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
6635	71	24	accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
6636	70	21	all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
6637	65	19	else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every
6638	66	19	apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn
6639	72	22	round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to
6640	61	17	splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.
6641	0	0	
6642	69	24	Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
6643	66	23	disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual
6644	69	19	in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's
6645	67	22	infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
6646	70	20	that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
6647	20	7	unintelligent agent.
6648	0	0	
6649	70	18	Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
6650	71	22	his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
6651	67	18	boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
6652	70	22	white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
6653	55	15	sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
6654	0	0	
6655	71	21	His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
6656	69	22	eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
6657	72	22	dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
6658	65	20	with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale.
6659	66	18	That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
6660	69	21	sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's
6661	67	20	leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no
6662	71	25	hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.
6663	72	21	Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
6664	70	23	encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,
6665	68	19	all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came
6666	63	17	to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his
6667	69	25	intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before
6668	71	27	him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which
6669	68	21	some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with
6670	70	20	half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been
6671	72	23	from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe
6672	72	22	one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced
6673	72	21	in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;
6674	69	23	but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he
6675	68	19	pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and
6676	69	17	torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice
6677	69	18	in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle
6678	68	20	demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly
6679	72	24	personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon
6680	68	20	the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt
6681	70	19	by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a
6682	47	12	mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.
6683	0	0	
6684	70	23	It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
6685	69	20	the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the
6686	71	23	monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
6687	69	22	corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
6688	68	21	probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
6689	69	18	Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
6690	72	21	months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one
6691	69	21	hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape;
6692	70	20	then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another;
6693	72	20	and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward
6694	71	25	voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems
6695	68	19	all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,
6696	70	21	he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital
6697	71	21	strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified
6698	66	20	by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even
6699	72	21	there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung
6700	72	21	to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable
6701	68	19	latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the
6702	72	23	tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed
6703	69	17	left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his
6704	69	19	dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that
6705	68	20	firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once
6706	71	22	again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even
6707	71	21	then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a
6708	70	19	cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but
6709	68	20	become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy
6710	67	21	subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson,
6711	69	17	when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the
6712	71	22	Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of
6713	72	20	Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not
6714	71	23	one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living
6715	68	22	agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may
6716	69	20	stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it,
6717	71	19	and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far
6718	71	18	from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
6719	71	22	thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon
6720	26	10	any one reasonable object.
6721	0	0	
6722	70	20	This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
6723	71	23	But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding
6724	71	19	far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where
6725	71	21	we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--and take your
6726	67	18	way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
6727	69	21	where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth, his root
6728	70	24	of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
6729	68	24	buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken
6730	69	20	throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he
6731	68	21	patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
6732	72	22	ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud,
6733	66	21	sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled
6734	71	21	royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
6735	0	0	
6736	70	19	Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means
6737	68	20	are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or
6738	70	19	change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
6739	69	17	dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling
6740	68	20	was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
6741	67	18	Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
6742	68	20	with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
6743	69	20	otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the
6744	42	13	terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
6745	0	0	
6746	67	25	The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
6747	70	23	ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
6748	66	20	always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the
6749	69	20	present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,
6750	68	19	that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
6751	69	19	account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
6752	72	23	isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he
6753	67	22	was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
6754	68	19	of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and
6755	71	22	scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
6756	69	22	idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
6757	69	20	his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
6758	71	23	Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
6759	71	23	yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
6760	71	20	his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,
6761	68	21	that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
6762	72	23	him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only
6763	72	21	and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his
6764	70	22	old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him
6765	71	22	then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the
6766	72	21	ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the
6767	71	20	profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an
6768	49	20	audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.
6769	0	0	
6770	72	19	Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
6771	69	20	Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
6772	72	22	up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals--morally enfeebled
6773	71	24	also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
6774	69	21	Starbuck, the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
6775	72	20	Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,
6776	72	22	seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
6777	72	23	to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded
6778	68	20	to the old man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
6779	68	21	that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much
6780	70	22	their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the White
6781	71	22	Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
6782	71	22	some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon
6783	71	23	of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
6784	72	22	Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
6785	71	18	tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
6786	68	19	pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow
6787	67	19	of a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the
6788	66	20	abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to
6789	69	23	encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest
6790	4	1	ill.

6797	69	20	What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
6798	33	11	was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

6800	70	24	Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
6801	69	23	could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm, there
6802	69	21	was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
6803	72	20	which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and
6804	72	21	yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of
6805	70	21	putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale
6806	71	21	that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself
6807	71	20	here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all
6808	31	8	these chapters might be naught.
6809	0	0	
6810	72	22	Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
6811	70	23	if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas,
6812	68	24	and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a
6813	67	22	certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old
6814	71	21	kings of Pegu placing the title "Lord of the White Elephants" above all
6815	70	23	their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings
6816	70	22	of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard;
6817	71	24	and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger;
6818	67	25	and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome,
6819	69	24	having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this
6820	69	23	pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white
6821	69	21	man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all
6822	69	21	this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among
6823	72	22	the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal
6824	69	20	sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many
6825	70	21	touching, noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age;
6826	64	20	though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt
6827	66	20	of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes,
6828	69	22	whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge,
6829	63	18	and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
6830	66	19	milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
6831	71	23	august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
6832	72	21	and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being
6833	71	22	held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove
6834	68	21	himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the
6835	67	23	noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was
6836	70	20	by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful
6837	72	22	creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit
6838	71	20	with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from
6839	66	20	the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of
6840	68	21	one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the
6841	70	19	cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is
6842	72	24	specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though
6843	69	22	in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and
6844	72	21	the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
6845	72	21	throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all
6846	71	26	these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable,
6847	71	24	and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea
6848	70	20	of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness
6849	25	6	which affrights in blood.
6850	0	0	
6851	71	22	This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
6852	67	21	divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
6853	67	19	terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
6854	72	20	Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
6855	66	17	what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent
6856	68	17	horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an
6857	66	20	abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb
6858	68	21	gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his
6859	66	23	heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or
6860	7	1	shark.*
6861	0	0	
6862	0	0	
6863	66	19	*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
6864	63	19	who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not
6865	67	21	the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
6866	70	23	hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
6867	60	16	it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
6868	66	23	irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
6869	71	23	fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
6870	68	22	two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us
6871	68	21	with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;
6872	71	23	yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
6873	7	2	terror.

6875	71	20	As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
6876	71	21	creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
6877	69	23	same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
6878	68	17	hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish
6879	70	21	mass for the dead begins with "Requiem eternam" (eternal rest), whence
6880	71	23	REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now,
6881	70	20	in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and
6882	62	17	the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him REQUIN.

6885	68	22	Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
6886	67	19	wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
6887	68	19	imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great,
6888	31	12	unflattering laureate, Nature.*

6891	69	21	*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
6892	68	20	gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
6893	69	22	below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the
6894	71	21	main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
6895	64	19	with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth
6896	66	19	its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
6897	71	20	flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
6898	65	18	cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through its
6899	69	22	inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took
6900	68	20	hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white
6901	67	20	thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
6902	70	23	waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
6903	71	19	towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only
6904	70	18	hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and
6905	71	21	turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
6906	70	24	never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
6907	69	21	thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
6908	70	21	learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross. So that by no
6909	72	22	possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those
6910	67	20	mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our
6911	68	18	deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be
6912	71	20	an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little
6913	50	15	brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
6914	0	0	
6915	65	18	I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
6916	72	19	chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this,
6917	68	19	that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses;
6918	72	23	and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I
6919	26	7	beheld the Antarctic fowl.
6920	0	0	
6921	68	17	But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will
6922	71	23	tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
6923	68	21	At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
6924	70	17	tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and then letting
6925	67	19	it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
6926	71	20	taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,
6927	35	11	the invoking, and adoring cherubim!

6930	66	22	Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of
6931	66	21	the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
6932	66	18	large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
6933	65	19	thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the
6934	68	20	elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
6935	68	20	days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At
6936	69	20	their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
6937	70	20	every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his
6938	68	21	mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
6939	68	20	resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A
6940	68	23	most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
6941	68	18	world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
6942	67	22	glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,
6943	69	18	bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid
6944	69	19	his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
6945	62	20	streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
6946	68	21	circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White
6947	72	20	Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his
6948	70	21	cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the
6949	69	21	bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor
6950	71	21	can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble
6951	72	20	horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him
6952	70	19	with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
6953	72	23	commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
6954	0	0	
6955	65	20	But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
6956	67	18	accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
6957	10	3	Albatross.

6959	71	21	What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
6960	68	20	the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It
6961	66	17	is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name
6962	69	22	he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men--has no substantive
6963	72	21	deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
6964	72	22	more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
6965	0	0	
6966	66	22	Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but
6967	64	22	not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces
6968	67	18	this crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the
6969	68	23	gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
6970	68	21	Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
6971	69	22	omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of
6972	68	18	that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
6973	71	23	faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the
6974	13	4	market-place!
6975	0	0	
6976	66	21	Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
6977	67	22	mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It
6978	69	22	cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
6979	68	19	the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
6980	62	20	there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
6981	68	22	consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And
6982	72	22	from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud
6983	66	21	in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to
6984	70	19	throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a
6985	72	22	milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even
6986	69	20	the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his
6987	13	4	pallid horse.

6989	67	22	Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
6990	67	17	thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
6991	69	27	idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
6992	0	0	
6993	68	20	But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
6994	67	21	account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then,
6995	64	20	by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
6996	70	20	whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
6997	68	24	of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
6998	69	22	but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however
6999	72	23	modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
7000	28	10	to the hidden cause we seek?
7001	0	0	
7002	68	18	Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
7003	71	24	and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
7004	69	25	though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
7005	70	20	to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
7006	72	24	entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
7007	16	4	recall them now.

7009	67	21	Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
7010	72	25	acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
7011	65	17	of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
7012	62	17	processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with
7013	69	21	new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the
7014	72	23	Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or
7015	54	19	a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
7016	0	0	
7017	68	22	Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
7018	65	16	kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White
7019	64	20	Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
7020	65	21	an untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
7021	67	19	neighbors--the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer
7022	72	23	towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods,
7023	68	22	comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
7024	72	22	that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is full of a soft,
7025	67	20	dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and
7026	68	22	longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness
7027	65	18	over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal
7028	68	20	thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by
7029	65	21	the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly
7030	70	20	unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading
7031	70	22	the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does "the tall pale man" of the
7032	70	18	Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the
7033	67	18	green of the groves--why is this phantom more terrible than all the
7034	32	8	whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
7035	0	0	
7036	64	19	Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
7037	60	19	earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
7038	69	21	tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
7039	69	21	field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
7040	67	21	(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
7041	70	21	house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;--it
7042	66	19	is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,
7043	68	20	saddest city thou can'st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and
7044	70	22	there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,
7045	68	20	this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful
7046	71	21	greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
7047	53	16	pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.
7048	0	0	
7049	69	21	I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
7050	68	22	is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
7051	72	25	objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught
7052	69	23	of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost
7053	71	23	solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under
7054	68	22	any form at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean
7055	69	20	by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the
7056	19	6	following examples.
7057	0	0	
7058	72	18	First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
7059	71	21	night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just
7060	71	24	enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely
7061	69	20	similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his
7062	66	19	ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness--as if from
7063	69	21	encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round
7064	70	22	him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom
7065	70	22	of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the
7066	71	20	lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go
7067	69	21	down; he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is
7068	68	19	the mariner who will tell thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of
7069	68	20	striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
7070	12	3	stirred me?"
7071	0	0	
7072	64	21	Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
7073	67	19	snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
7074	71	22	mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
7075	68	23	altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be
7076	71	23	to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
7077	68	22	backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
7078	69	23	unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
7079	72	22	to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the
7080	69	20	scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick
7081	69	21	of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
7082	72	23	shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
7083	71	20	views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
7084	37	11	ice monuments and splintered crosses.
7085	0	0	
7086	72	22	But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but
7087	70	22	a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,
7088	8	3	Ishmael.
7089	0	0	
7090	70	20	Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
7091	69	18	Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon the
7092	71	22	sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
7093	69	19	he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness--why
7094	72	18	will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
7095	66	19	of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
7096	70	21	creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
7097	70	22	smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
7098	69	16	former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black
7099	25	8	bisons of distant Oregon?
7100	0	0	
7101	69	21	No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
7102	70	20	knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
7103	72	19	Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
7104	72	22	herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
7105	45	11	this instant they may be trampling into dust.
7106	0	0	
7107	68	17	Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings
7108	67	21	of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
7109	70	22	windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking
7110	44	13	of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
7111	0	0	
7112	70	19	Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
7113	69	17	sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
7114	67	18	those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible
7115	72	21	world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
7116	0	0	
7117	65	20	But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
7118	68	20	learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
7119	64	20	and far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the
7120	66	18	most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
7121	72	21	Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in
7122	37	9	things the most appalling to mankind.
7123	0	0	
7124	69	20	Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
7125	71	21	and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
7126	69	20	thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
7127	70	22	way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
7128	71	24	the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
7129	69	20	colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,
7130	71	23	full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a colourless, all-colour
7131	71	19	of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory
7132	71	21	of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues--every stately
7133	71	22	or lovely emblazoning--the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
7134	66	18	and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
7135	69	22	young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
7136	72	23	in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature
7137	70	22	absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but
7138	72	21	the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that
7139	69	21	the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
7140	71	22	principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and
7141	70	24	if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even
7142	67	17	tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this, the
7143	70	25	palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in
7144	69	24	Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their
7145	67	20	eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental
7146	69	19	white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these
7147	67	18	things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery
7148	5	1	hunt?

7157	72	22	It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
7158	72	20	cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
7159	71	19	scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets
7160	70	17	to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
7161	71	21	precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
7162	71	20	their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
7163	71	21	only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
7164	27	9	unceasingly advancing keel.

7201	22	4	CHAPTER 44. The Chart.

7204	71	23	Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
7205	72	24	took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
7206	69	21	with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom,
7207	70	20	and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread
7208	70	21	them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before
7209	64	21	it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and
7210	71	19	shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace
7211	71	24	additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he
7212	71	23	would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down
7213	69	24	the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various
7214	46	13	ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.
7215	0	0	
7216	71	21	While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
7217	72	21	head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
7218	68	18	shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
7219	69	22	almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses
7220	72	21	on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
7221	53	17	courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
7222	0	0	
7223	68	20	But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
7224	71	20	cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
7225	67	20	brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
7226	70	22	others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before
7227	69	22	him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to
7228	71	23	the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
7229	0	0	
7230	69	21	Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
7231	69	22	it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
7232	65	22	creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it
7233	70	19	seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby
7234	71	19	calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and, also, calling
7235	70	23	to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
7236	69	25	latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
7237	72	23	certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground
7238	22	6	in search of his prey.
7239	0	0	
7240	68	22	So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
7241	72	20	sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that,
7242	71	22	could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the
7243	65	22	logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated,
7244	70	21	then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
7245	72	21	invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
7246	70	22	On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
7247	27	6	charts of the sperm whale.*
7248	0	0	
7249	65	18	     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
7250	64	21	     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of
7251	63	14	     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
7252	64	17	     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
7253	62	20	     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in
7254	63	17	     the circular. "This chart divides the ocean into districts
7255	62	21	     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;
7256	63	17	     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
7257	65	16	     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
7258	63	17	     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
7259	56	15	     of days that have been spent in each month in every
7260	63	15	     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
7261	51	12	     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen."
7262	0	0	
7263	70	23	Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
7264	69	19	sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather, secret
7265	70	20	intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are called;
7266	67	24	continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
7267	67	20	exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with
7268	67	22	one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
7269	70	22	direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel,
7270	62	18	and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
7271	68	22	unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these
7272	68	21	times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
7273	66	19	(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but
7274	64	19	never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads,
7275	69	18	when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
7276	69	20	particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating
7277	47	15	whales may with great confidence be looked for.
7278	0	0	
7279	67	21	And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
7280	71	22	feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
7281	67	20	the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
7282	72	20	art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
7283	30	10	without prospect of a meeting.
7284	0	0	
7285	68	20	There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
7286	65	21	delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,
7287	70	23	perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
7288	67	21	for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
7289	68	21	herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
7290	72	22	say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found
7291	72	27	there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable
7292	69	20	instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the
7293	69	23	same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries
7294	69	19	and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby
7295	71	22	Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the
7296	68	24	Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese
7297	69	22	Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of
7298	72	22	those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly
7299	68	22	encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where
7300	70	23	he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual
7301	72	21	stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged
7302	64	20	abode. And where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have
7303	64	22	hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever
7304	64	21	way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular
7305	68	25	set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become
7306	70	21	probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next
7307	71	23	thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined
7308	72	22	in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then,
7309	72	24	for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried,
7310	70	22	lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round,
7311	69	23	loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There
7312	72	21	it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had
7313	72	23	taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was
7314	72	23	that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive
7315	71	26	to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
7316	71	22	vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
7317	68	20	hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
7318	70	22	crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
7319	71	22	hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
7320	51	18	unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.

7322	70	21	Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
7323	72	25	Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
7324	72	22	to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running
7325	71	27	down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time
7326	69	23	to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season.
7327	65	21	Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been
7328	66	19	correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of
7329	65	19	things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days
7330	68	20	and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently
7331	69	22	enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance
7332	66	21	the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his
7333	68	20	periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the
7334	66	20	Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other
7335	67	18	waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor'-Westers,
7336	63	17	Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might
7337	68	20	blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's
7338	22	8	circumnavigating wake.
7339	0	0	
7340	72	19	But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
7341	69	23	but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
7342	67	24	whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
7343	65	22	recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the
7344	63	20	thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar
7345	68	17	snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but
7346	68	23	be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter
7347	71	19	to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
7348	71	21	would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape?
7349	72	23	His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear! And
7350	70	22	here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness
7351	68	22	and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the
7352	65	17	deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances
7353	68	23	of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved
7354	72	20	revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own
7355	26	7	bloody nails in his palms.

7357	71	20	Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
7358	69	18	dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through
7359	71	20	the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
7360	71	19	round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing
7361	72	24	of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes
7362	68	22	the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its
7363	69	20	base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and
7364	71	20	lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among
7365	71	18	them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be
7366	71	19	heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his
7367	70	21	state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,
7368	68	20	perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent
7369	68	20	weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens
7370	63	16	of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,
7371	68	21	unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had
7372	71	20	gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from
7373	67	21	it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or
7374	66	21	soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the
7375	67	21	characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer
7376	67	21	vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching
7377	66	18	contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no
7378	70	22	longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
7379	71	23	the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up
7380	70	22	all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,
7381	67	19	by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and
7382	70	21	devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay,
7383	69	19	could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was
7384	71	20	conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth.
7385	68	21	Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when
7386	69	22	what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated
7387	68	19	thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be
7388	67	22	sure, but without an object to colour, and therefore a blankness in
7389	68	20	itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature
7390	69	22	in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a
7391	70	23	vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature
7392	11	4	he creates.

7399	72	23	So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
7400	71	24	indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars
7401	68	21	in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier
7402	68	21	part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the
7403	69	23	leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly
7404	68	25	enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to
7405	66	23	take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire
7406	70	22	subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main
7407	22	7	points of this affair.
7408	0	0	
7409	66	17	I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall
7410	69	24	be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
7411	72	21	items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
7412	70	24	citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of
7413	7	2	itself.
7414	0	0	
7415	67	20	First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
7416	66	23	receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
7417	67	21	interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by
7418	69	18	the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
7419	68	20	private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where
7420	70	22	three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I
7421	67	19	think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
7422	71	22	them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
7423	71	23	Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far
7424	71	24	into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
7425	65	21	often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas,
7426	70	21	with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
7427	66	20	unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have
7428	70	22	been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
7429	69	19	brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.
7430	71	23	This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the
7431	72	20	other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that
7432	71	19	is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack,
7433	67	18	saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards
7434	68	21	taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out
7435	68	18	that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time
7436	68	22	distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's
7437	72	24	eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years,
7438	69	21	but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances,
7439	68	18	then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many
7440	69	21	other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
7441	23	8	good ground to impeach.
7442	0	0	
7443	71	19	Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
7444	69	23	the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
7445	70	25	historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
7446	70	21	distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
7447	65	20	thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
7448	70	26	peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
7449	68	19	in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
7450	68	23	peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
7451	70	23	valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
7452	67	23	of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
7453	64	22	such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that
7454	69	21	most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
7455	67	21	tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
7456	68	28	without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some
7457	67	21	poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
7458	71	23	make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
7459	72	23	pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for
7460	18	6	their presumption.
7461	0	0	
7462	67	23	But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
7463	69	21	celebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
7464	69	24	famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
7465	72	21	but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of
7466	71	23	a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar. Was it not so,
7467	71	23	O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
7468	69	20	did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft
7469	70	20	seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack!
7470	71	22	thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of
7471	69	20	the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty
7472	65	19	jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross
7473	72	22	against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked
7474	70	21	like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain
7475	69	22	prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean
7476	50	14	History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.
7477	0	0	
7478	69	22	But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
7479	69	22	times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
7480	70	21	finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
7481	61	18	by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with
7482	66	19	that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
7483	71	22	Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture
7484	68	25	that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the
7485	19	6	Indian King Philip.
7486	0	0	
7487	69	21	I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
7488	69	21	mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
7489	67	20	printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
7490	68	21	whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For
7491	70	23	this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
7492	69	21	as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
7493	65	18	the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without
7494	69	21	some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
7495	69	18	fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
7496	62	23	worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
7497	0	0	
7498	68	22	First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
7499	70	20	perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
7500	68	19	conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.
7501	72	23	One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
7502	72	22	deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
7503	71	24	however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
7504	66	17	that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
7505	68	23	whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the
7506	69	22	bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan--do you suppose that that
7507	70	24	poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
7508	69	24	to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular
7509	69	23	between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
7510	70	23	called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
7511	71	24	that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
7512	68	19	others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a
7513	69	21	death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each
7514	69	20	lost a boat's crew. For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and
7515	72	21	candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was
7516	15	4	spilled for it.
7517	0	0	
7518	72	28	Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
7519	71	26	an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
7520	70	22	narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,
7521	70	22	they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I
7522	71	26	declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
7523	50	14	when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
7524	0	0	
7525	69	24	But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
7526	71	19	testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
7527	70	23	Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
7528	72	23	malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
7529	65	18	sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS done it.
7530	0	0	
7531	70	18	First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,
7532	70	23	was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
7533	70	22	boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of
7534	68	20	the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
7535	70	20	from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
7536	72	21	ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in
7537	71	19	less than "ten minutes" she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving
7538	70	22	plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of
7539	70	21	the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last,
7540	70	24	Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another
7541	63	17	ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and
7542	70	18	breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith
7543	71	22	forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain
7544	67	22	Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was
7545	67	22	chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his
7546	68	21	plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all
7547	57	17	this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*
7548	0	0	
7549	0	0	
7550	70	21	*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: "Every fact seemed
7551	65	17	to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
7552	70	23	directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
7553	64	18	a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
7554	66	21	direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
7555	72	20	ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock;
7556	71	22	to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His
7557	71	20	aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He
7558	69	20	came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in
7559	69	20	which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge
7560	69	20	for their sufferings." Again: "At all events, the whole circumstances
7561	71	21	taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the
7562	69	21	time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the
7563	66	18	part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall),
7564	59	20	induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion."
7565	0	0	
7566	66	22	Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during
7567	66	20	a black night an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
7568	71	21	hospitable shore. "The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
7569	63	19	fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
7570	66	19	upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
7571	66	20	contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the
7572	69	20	dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
7573	70	22	wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance."
7574	0	0	
7575	72	20	In another place--p. 45,--he speaks of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK
7576	15	5	OF THE ANIMAL."

7579	65	18	Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
7580	65	20	totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
7581	66	22	particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
7582	72	23	though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions
7583	6	2	to it.
7584	0	0	
7585	63	18	Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then
7586	70	21	commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
7587	69	20	dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in
7588	71	22	the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,
7589	71	22	the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
7590	71	21	ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
7591	72	23	denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
7592	69	22	as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there
7593	64	21	is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this
7594	68	20	impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a
7595	68	19	portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential business
7596	72	19	with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such
7597	72	19	a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest
7598	69	24	port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider
7599	71	23	the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul
7600	70	21	of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the
7601	35	9	sperm whale will stand no nonsense.

7603	70	21	I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little circumstance
7604	70	22	in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you
7605	71	19	must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern's
7606	68	22	famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.
7607	55	15	Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
7608	0	0	
7609	70	19	"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day
7610	72	24	we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very
7611	71	23	clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
7612	67	18	our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not
7613	70	18	till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An
7614	72	19	uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,
7615	68	20	lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any
7616	67	18	one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,
7617	70	20	was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking
7618	69	20	against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this
7619	69	22	gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at
7620	72	22	least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,
7621	70	19	while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding
7622	69	19	that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster
7623	65	18	sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf
7624	69	23	applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel
7625	70	20	had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily
7626	35	12	it had escaped entirely uninjured."
7627	0	0	
7628	65	19	Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
7629	63	22	question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
7630	63	22	adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
7631	69	23	Dorchester near Boston. I have the honour of being a nephew of his. I
7632	71	22	have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.
7633	71	21	He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large
7634	69	21	one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my
7635	67	21	uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.

7637	72	22	In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
7638	71	24	of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier's
7639	68	20	old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted
7640	62	18	from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
7641	41	15	corroborative example, if such be needed.

7643	66	19	Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John Ferdinando," as he calls
7644	69	21	the modern Juan Fernandes. "In our way thither," he says, "about four
7645	72	23	o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues
7646	71	22	from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our
7647	69	19	men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were
7648	72	22	or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed,
7649	68	19	the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the
7650	67	19	ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little
7651	65	18	over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The
7652	66	20	suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and
7653	72	23	several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who
7654	69	20	lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!" Lionel then
7655	71	25	goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate
7656	66	24	the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about
7657	69	20	that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But
7658	70	20	I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the
7659	69	20	morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically
7660	30	8	bumping the hull from beneath.
7661	0	0	
7662	71	23	I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
7663	70	22	me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
7664	69	21	than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
7665	66	18	boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
7666	71	17	withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
7667	67	17	Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength,
7668	71	23	let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
7669	70	19	running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
7670	70	21	secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
7671	70	20	horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if
7672	69	18	the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
7673	67	20	not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
7674	70	24	destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
7675	72	23	indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently
7676	65	22	open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several
7677	67	22	consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a
7678	72	22	concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which
7679	71	22	you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in
7680	72	20	this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these
7681	72	23	marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for
7682	72	22	the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is nothing new
7683	14	4	under the sun.

7685	70	22	In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate
7686	72	24	of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius
7687	68	19	general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work
7688	72	24	every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
7689	69	22	considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in
7690	70	21	some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently
7691	16	6	to be mentioned.
7692	0	0	
7693	69	19	Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
7694	69	23	of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
7695	71	23	in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed
7696	68	21	vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
7697	67	20	years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
7698	71	24	gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species
7699	69	20	this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as
7700	71	21	well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly
7701	68	18	inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long
7702	66	20	time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
7703	67	22	Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am
7704	65	20	certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
7705	67	23	present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
7706	70	21	resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in
7707	70	24	modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
7708	68	22	sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that
7709	65	20	on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found
7710	69	21	the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes
7711	70	21	through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
7712	49	17	pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
7713	0	0	
7714	72	23	In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
7715	70	21	called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have
7716	66	22	every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale--squid or
7717	70	22	cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures,
7718	64	18	but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its
7719	66	19	surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
7720	72	23	reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
7721	71	22	human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove
7722	71	22	the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
7723	6	2	whale.

7729	0	0	
7730	66	20	Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
7731	72	23	thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
7732	68	23	though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
7733	69	21	passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
7734	68	24	habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, altogether to
7735	64	23	abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if
7736	67	22	this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
7737	66	21	influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even
7738	70	22	considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
7739	69	22	White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
7740	71	18	sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
7741	69	23	multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
7742	72	23	prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed
7743	71	25	exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though
7744	70	18	not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet
7745	42	13	were by no means incapable of swaying him.
7746	0	0	
7747	70	22	To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in
7748	70	21	the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,
7749	70	21	for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
7750	71	21	over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
7751	66	24	man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
7752	72	22	mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a
7753	71	20	sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck's body and Starbuck's coerced will
7754	71	19	were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still
7755	67	19	he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his
7756	71	21	captain's quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from
7757	71	22	it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse
7758	64	19	ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck
7759	69	24	would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
7760	70	23	captain's leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
7761	71	21	influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
7762	67	20	insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly
7763	69	23	manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
7764	70	18	that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
7765	65	22	strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that
7766	69	20	the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
7767	72	24	background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted meditation
7768	69	19	unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches,
7769	71	20	his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby
7770	72	24	Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the
7771	72	23	announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less
7772	70	25	capricious and unreliable--they live in the varying outer weather, and
7773	71	22	they inhale its fickleness--and when retained for any object remote and
7774	67	21	blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the
7775	66	21	end, it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and
7776	70	20	employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the
7777	11	3	final dash.
7778	0	0	
7779	67	21	Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
7780	71	24	mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
7781	71	24	The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
7782	68	19	Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
7783	70	21	hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
7784	72	21	breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the
7785	65	20	love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food
7786	68	21	for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and
7787	65	20	chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
7788	65	19	thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
7789	63	20	committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
7790	70	20	perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final
7791	72	22	and romantic object--that final and romantic object, too many would have
7792	72	19	turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all
7793	70	17	hopes of cash--aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some months
7794	67	19	go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same
7795	71	22	quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon
7796	13	5	cashier Ahab.
7797	0	0	
7798	69	24	Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
7799	67	20	to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
7800	66	23	somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
7801	67	22	Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,
7802	65	21	he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
7803	69	20	usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
7804	67	20	if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
7805	69	20	obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From
7806	65	23	even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
7807	70	23	consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must
7808	68	23	of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection
7809	69	20	could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
7810	66	22	backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
7811	72	22	atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected
7812	3	1	to.
7813	0	0	
7814	65	20	For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
7815	70	21	verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
7816	68	25	degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's
7817	66	20	voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
7818	71	23	himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
7819	26	9	pursuit of his profession.
7820	0	0	
7821	70	22	Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
7822	71	22	mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
7823	70	23	reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.

7830	66	21	It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
7831	71	23	about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
7832	71	23	Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
7833	67	22	for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet
7834	71	24	somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
7835	71	24	lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
7836	15	5	invisible self.
7837	0	0	
7838	68	23	I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I
7839	65	20	kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between
7840	69	16	the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
7841	69	23	Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
7842	72	21	between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and
7843	69	21	unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did
7844	71	20	there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by
7845	72	21	the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were
7846	66	21	the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving
7847	70	21	and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp
7848	68	21	subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and
7849	68	22	that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending
7850	68	19	of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here,
7851	65	15	thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own
7852	71	26	destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive,
7853	71	20	indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly,
7854	68	17	or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference
7855	70	20	in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final
7856	63	17	aspect of the completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I,
7857	63	16	which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this
7858	67	19	easy, indifferent sword must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and
7859	68	22	necessity--nowise incompatible--all interweavingly working together.
7860	67	19	The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate
7861	70	22	course--its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that;
7862	66	18	free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and
7863	63	18	chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of
7864	68	20	necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
7865	69	17	thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
7866	30	9	last featuring blow at events.

7869	66	22	Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
7870	68	16	strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball
7871	70	19	of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds
7872	72	21	whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was
7873	69	20	that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward,
7874	68	20	his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he
7875	67	21	continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment
7876	66	19	perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen's
7877	71	21	look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could
7878	70	22	that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from
7879	22	7	Tashtego the Indian's.
7880	0	0	
7881	66	21	As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
7882	68	23	eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
7883	70	20	prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries
7884	24	8	announcing their coming.

7894	69	19	The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and

7896	26	8	other tribes of his genus.

7906	69	16	The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
7907	70	22	before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
7908	71	24	leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
7909	69	19	our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
7910	69	22	when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
7911	72	20	concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the
7912	71	24	opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action;
7913	69	21	for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had
7914	70	24	been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of
7915	69	21	the men selected for shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the
7916	66	21	boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The
7917	70	22	sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed
7918	69	20	in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed,
7919	71	23	and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over
7920	68	20	high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
7921	72	23	clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale.
7922	70	21	So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on
7923	22	6	board an enemy's ship.
7924	0	0	
7925	69	22	But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
7926	71	20	every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
7927	70	21	surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.

7934	70	20	The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
7935	67	21	of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
7936	69	18	tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always
7937	65	21	been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the
7938	68	20	captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The
7939	68	18	figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
7940	67	20	tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese
7941	72	20	jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers
7942	66	17	of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a
7943	67	22	glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled
7944	70	21	round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of
7945	67	23	this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to
7946	69	26	some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;--a race notorious for
7947	66	21	a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners
7948	67	22	supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the
7949	70	22	water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be
7950	10	4	elsewhere.
7951	0	0	
7952	72	20	While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers,
7953	70	23	Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, "All ready
7954	17	5	there, Fedallah?"
7955	0	0	
7956	35	8	"Ready," was the half-hissed reply.
7957	0	0	
7958	67	19	"Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck. "Lower away
7959	14	4	there, I say."
7960	0	0	
7961	72	22	Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
7962	69	19	sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
7963	70	22	wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
7964	62	19	off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,
7965	68	21	goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats
7966	6	2	below.
7967	0	0	
7968	67	18	Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth
7969	70	19	keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
7970	72	19	showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern,
7971	70	18	loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely,
7972	70	24	so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again
7973	70	21	riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other
7974	29	9	boats obeyed not the command.
7975	0	0	
7976	32	9	"Captain Ahab?--" said Starbuck.
7977	0	0	
7978	72	21	"Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,
7979	26	9	pull out more to leeward!"
7980	0	0	
7981	64	19	"Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round
7982	56	15	his great steering oar. "Lay back!" addressing his crew.
7983	69	19	"There!--there!--there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!--lay
7984	6	1	back!"
7985	0	0	
7986	39	10	"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."
7987	0	0	
7988	66	17	"Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now.
7989	72	20	Didn't I hear 'em in the hold? And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it? What
7990	47	12	say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."
7991	0	0	
7992	69	15	"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
7993	71	18	ones," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
7994	70	20	still showed signs of uneasiness. "Why don't you break your backbones,
7995	71	19	my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They
7996	68	20	are only five more hands come to help us--never mind from where--the
7997	71	19	more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone--devils
7998	69	22	are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that's the stroke
7999	68	19	for a thousand pounds; that's the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah
8000	71	19	for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men--all hearts
8001	70	18	alive! Easy, easy; don't be in a hurry--don't be in a hurry. Why don't
8002	70	22	you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
8003	70	13	then:--softly, softly! That's it--that's it! long and strong. Give way
8004	71	22	there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are
8005	69	17	all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,
8006	70	18	can't ye? pull, won't ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
8007	72	19	don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!
8008	72	19	Here!" whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; "every mother's son
8009	71	19	of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth. That's
8010	70	18	it--that's it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my steel-bits.
8011	67	14	Start her--start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes!"
8012	0	0	
8013	67	22	Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
8014	70	23	rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
8015	70	22	inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
8016	70	21	specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
8017	66	20	with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
8018	68	20	peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
8019	68	20	tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
8020	72	23	calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such
8021	68	23	queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for
8022	70	23	the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and
8023	72	22	indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly
8024	67	20	gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the mere sight of such a yawning
8025	72	20	commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.
8026	71	21	Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity
8027	69	26	is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their
8028	36	11	guard in the matter of obeying them.
8029	0	0	
8030	68	22	In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
8031	66	19	across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
8032	49	15	pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
8033	0	0	
8034	68	18	"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
8035	8	3	please!"
8036	0	0	
8037	66	19	"Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
8038	69	18	spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
8039	26	6	like a flint from Stubb's.
8040	0	0	
8041	41	10	"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!
8042	0	0	
8043	69	18	"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
8044	70	21	boys!)" in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: "A sad
8045	71	17	business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
8046	69	15	Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
8047	69	14	will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
8048	71	13	Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm's the
8049	59	14	play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand."
8050	0	0	
8051	65	20	"Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
8052	71	21	diverged, "as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I thought so. Aye, and that's
8053	65	18	what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
8054	71	20	suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale's at the bottom
8055	71	17	of it. Well, well, so be it! Can't be helped! All right! Give way, men!
8056	43	13	It ain't the White Whale to-day! Give way!"
8057	0	0	
8058	71	21	Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
8059	69	20	as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
8060	64	23	awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's
8061	68	21	company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got
8062	68	21	abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
8063	71	23	small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge
8064	68	17	of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb's confident way
8065	69	23	of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
8066	72	23	superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for
8067	70	21	all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab's precise agency in the
8068	69	20	matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious
8069	72	23	shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket
8070	70	23	dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
8071	0	0	
8072	64	22	Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
8073	67	19	furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
8074	70	21	circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
8075	65	23	yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
8076	71	17	trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
8077	69	23	periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
8078	66	23	boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen
8079	69	21	pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
8080	67	19	displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
8081	70	22	gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
8082	70	23	horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a
8083	72	21	fencer's, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any
8084	72	23	tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in
8085	71	23	a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once
8086	68	24	the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,
8087	68	25	while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and
8088	71	21	crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the
8089	67	21	rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
8090	69	20	down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
8091	63	19	movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.
8092	0	0	
8093	69	23	"Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck. "Thou, Queequeg,
8094	10	2	stand up!"
8095	0	0	
8096	71	21	Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
8097	70	22	stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
8098	70	23	spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
8099	70	21	stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
8100	68	20	the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
8101	68	17	himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently
8102	36	13	eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.
8103	0	0	
8104	72	17	Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still; its
8105	69	20	commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout
8106	67	22	sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the
8107	67	17	level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the
8108	71	21	whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand,
8109	66	19	and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the
8110	71	18	mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
8111	72	18	King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post was
8112	70	21	full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point
8113	41	10	of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.
8114	0	0	
8115	69	22	"I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
8116	6	1	that."
8117	0	0	
8118	66	21	Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
8119	70	18	way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
8120	25	8	shoulders for a pedestal.
8121	0	0	
8122	47	14	"Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?"
8123	0	0	
8124	69	17	"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
8125	19	5	fifty feet taller."
8126	0	0	
8127	69	21	Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
8128	71	21	boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
8129	69	18	Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head
8130	68	19	and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous
8131	71	18	fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was
8132	68	19	Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
8133	49	14	breastband to lean against and steady himself by.
8134	0	0	
8135	71	21	At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
8136	65	23	habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
8137	66	21	posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
8138	70	20	perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily
8139	69	20	perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the
8140	72	24	sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;
8141	68	21	for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,
8142	71	23	barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously
8143	67	20	rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed
8144	67	20	a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly
8145	67	24	vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then
8146	69	23	stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to
8147	72	20	the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the
8148	71	22	living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her
8149	17	5	seasons for that.
8150	0	0	
8151	60	17	Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
8152	71	24	solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
8153	65	19	not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
8154	70	20	Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
8155	68	19	languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,
8156	71	24	where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed
8157	72	19	home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match
8158	70	21	across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer,
8159	70	20	whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly
8160	71	22	dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a
8161	72	17	quick phrensy of hurry, "Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!"
8162	0	0	
8163	67	20	To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
8164	68	21	visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
8165	63	19	water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and
8166	69	20	suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
8167	68	20	rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
8168	69	24	were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
8169	69	21	atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
8170	71	22	water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
8171	71	24	indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their forerunning
8172	39	13	couriers and detached flying outriders.
8173	0	0	
8174	68	23	All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
8175	68	21	water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,
8176	69	20	as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
8177	6	1	hills.
8178	0	0	
8179	69	17	"Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
8180	71	20	intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
8181	68	21	from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
8182	71	22	visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much
8183	67	16	to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the
8184	70	21	silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
8185	66	17	peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
8186	0	0	
8187	69	19	How different the loud little King-Post. "Sing out and say something,
8188	72	20	my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their
8189	68	16	black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll sign over to you my
8190	70	19	Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys.
8191	70	17	Lay me on--lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!
8192	71	21	See! see that white water!" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his
8193	71	19	head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far
8194	72	21	off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's
8195	42	13	stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
8196	0	0	
8197	69	17	"Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
8198	67	22	unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
8199	69	16	short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has. Fits?
8200	71	16	yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em. Merrily,
8201	71	18	merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;--merry's the word.
8202	67	17	Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all. But what the devil are you
8203	68	15	hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and
8204	67	20	keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your
8205	69	19	knives in two--that's all. Take it easy--why don't ye take it easy, I
8206	42	10	say, and burst all your livers and lungs!"
8207	0	0	
8208	71	21	But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
8209	71	22	his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
8210	71	23	light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious
8211	69	20	seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
8212	60	18	red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.

8214	68	24	Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
8215	64	18	Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious monster which
8216	65	19	he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its
8217	71	24	tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
8218	68	23	they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
8219	65	20	over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen
8220	68	21	must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage
8221	68	19	pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
8222	32	9	arms, in these critical moments.
8223	0	0	
8224	67	18	It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
8225	72	22	omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
8226	69	21	the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green;
8227	72	22	the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on
8228	72	23	the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening
8229	67	19	to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and
8230	72	22	hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite
8231	68	19	hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;--all these,
8232	72	21	with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps
8233	67	21	of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing
8234	70	21	down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her
8235	41	10	screaming brood;--all this was thrilling.

8237	71	21	Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
8238	67	19	heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering the
8239	68	19	first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can feel
8240	68	18	stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
8241	66	18	time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the
8242	19	5	hunted sperm whale.
8243	0	0	
8244	72	22	The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
8245	66	20	visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows
8246	68	20	flung upon the sea. The jets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted
8247	71	22	everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.
8248	71	22	The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales
8249	66	19	running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still
8250	70	19	rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through
8251	71	22	the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
8252	37	10	escape being torn from the row-locks.
8253	0	0	
8254	72	23	Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship
8255	20	7	nor boat to be seen.
8256	0	0	
8257	72	18	"Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
8258	71	22	of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
8259	46	13	There's white water again!--close to! Spring!"
8260	0	0	
8261	68	24	Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
8262	71	19	that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when
8263	69	17	with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: "Stand up!" and
8264	46	15	Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
8265	0	0	
8266	70	22	Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
8267	70	24	so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
8268	65	18	of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
8269	68	22	instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
8270	70	20	fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still
8271	70	21	booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
8272	39	11	the erected crests of enraged serpents.
8273	0	0	
8274	68	17	"That's his hump. THERE, THERE, give it to him!" whispered Starbuck.
8275	0	0	
8276	71	23	A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
8277	70	25	Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
8278	67	21	astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
8279	66	19	collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by;
8280	69	23	something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
8281	69	21	crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the
8282	70	20	white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all
8283	68	19	blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
8284	0	0	
8285	71	20	Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round
8286	71	21	it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
8287	72	23	tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
8288	71	21	water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
8289	70	21	the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom
8290	13	5	of the ocean.
8291	0	0	
8292	71	21	The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
8293	68	22	the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white
8294	70	23	fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal
8295	71	23	in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar
8296	69	22	to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
8297	69	17	boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
8298	68	18	darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
8299	71	24	The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were
8300	68	21	useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.
8301	72	21	So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures
8302	69	18	Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching
8303	71	25	it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this
8304	69	20	forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in
8305	69	17	the heart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign
8306	68	20	and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the
8307	17	5	midst of despair.
8308	0	0	
8309	70	19	Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
8310	69	21	we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over
8311	65	18	the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
8312	69	22	Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.
8313	72	21	We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by
8314	71	20	the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly
8315	71	21	parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as
8316	70	22	the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a
8317	42	11	distance of not much more than its length.
8318	0	0	
8319	70	23	Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
8320	69	21	tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a
8321	67	19	cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
8322	72	23	more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed
8323	70	21	against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
8324	71	23	board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
8325	71	21	their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us
8326	70	19	up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of
8327	39	14	our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.

8334	72	26	There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
8335	70	22	we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
8336	65	18	joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than
8337	67	19	suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own. However,
8338	68	18	nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts
8339	67	19	down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard
8340	69	19	things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of
8341	70	18	potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small
8342	66	19	difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of
8343	65	17	life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
8344	71	21	good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
8345	72	23	and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking
8346	71	25	of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes
8347	68	18	in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might
8348	70	22	have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the
8349	71	22	general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this
8350	69	22	free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now
8351	71	23	regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its
8352	7	2	object.

8354	72	20	"Queequeg," said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
8355	67	16	and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
8356	65	19	"Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?"
8357	71	24	Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to
8358	45	11	understand that such things did often happen.
8359	0	0	
8360	68	16	"Mr. Stubb," said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
8361	70	18	oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; "Mr. Stubb, I
8362	71	24	think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
8363	69	18	mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
8364	70	19	then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
8365	49	15	squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?"
8366	0	0	
8367	72	24	"Certain. I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
8368	6	1	Horn."
8369	0	0	
8370	72	17	"Mr. Flask," said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
8371	69	21	by; "you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell
8372	70	19	me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
8373	72	21	oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death's
8374	6	1	jaws?"
8375	0	0	
8376	65	14	"Can't you twist that smaller?" said Flask. "Yes, that's the law.
8377	67	23	I should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face
8378	67	19	foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
8379	6	1	that!"
8380	0	0	
8381	71	24	Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement
8382	71	22	of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
8383	63	21	in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters
8384	66	20	of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
8385	72	22	superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my
8386	72	23	life into the hands of him who steered the boat--oftentimes a fellow who
8387	71	22	at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling
8388	62	15	the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that the
8389	72	25	particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed
8390	70	20	to Starbuck's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall,
8391	66	18	and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his
8392	69	21	great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this
8393	69	19	uncommonly prudent Starbuck's boat; and finally considering in what a
8394	68	21	devil's chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all
8395	69	20	things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a
8396	72	21	rough draft of my will. "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my
8397	31	11	lawyer, executor, and legatee."

8399	72	22	It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
8400	68	20	last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more
8401	68	21	fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life
8402	69	21	that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon
8403	68	23	the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away
8404	71	21	from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good
8405	70	22	as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary
8406	70	21	clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived
8407	64	18	myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. I looked
8408	68	21	round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean
8409	58	18	conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.
8410	0	0	
8411	70	19	Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
8412	70	23	here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
8413	25	6	devil fetch the hindmost.

8422	50	13	with my timber toe. Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"

8424	70	18	"I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account," said Flask.

8427	16	4	left, you know."

8432	69	24	Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
8433	72	24	the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is
8434	72	24	right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils
8435	70	23	of the chase. So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their
8436	70	24	eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the
8437	22	5	thickest of the fight.
8438	0	0	
8439	65	23	But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering
8440	70	18	that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
8441	64	20	considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
8442	70	24	extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
8443	63	20	comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any
8444	69	22	maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the
8445	57	17	joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
8446	0	0	
8447	70	20	Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
8448	69	24	his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
8449	68	22	the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
8450	66	22	his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually
8451	67	23	apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above all for
8452	68	22	Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat's
8453	70	21	crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
8454	68	23	of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat's
8455	70	19	crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
8456	66	22	Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all
8457	71	21	that matter. Until Cabaco's published discovery, the sailors had little
8458	67	23	foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out
8459	70	19	of port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
8460	71	22	whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then
8461	68	19	found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his
8462	69	20	own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
8463	69	20	solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
8464	68	21	running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was
8465	67	22	observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
8466	68	22	coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
8467	70	21	withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
8468	72	20	he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
8469	72	23	sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the
8470	70	21	knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed
8471	70	22	how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
8472	70	21	semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter's chisel
8473	70	24	gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these
8474	72	22	things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
8475	70	23	almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness
8476	68	21	in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick;
8477	69	22	for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster
8478	70	22	in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest
8479	60	19	suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that boat.
8480	0	0	
8481	67	21	Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
8482	67	20	away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
8483	71	22	unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
8484	65	21	nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
8485	67	19	whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
8486	68	21	creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
8487	70	20	oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that
8488	70	20	Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
8489	65	21	to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
8490	29	10	excitement in the forecastle.
8491	0	0	
8492	67	21	But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
8493	71	21	phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
8494	68	21	somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained
8495	70	19	a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like
8496	69	22	this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
8497	70	22	linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
8498	69	22	of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even
8499	62	20	authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain
8500	65	22	an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as
8501	66	24	civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
8502	67	17	dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide
8503	71	26	among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles
8504	70	25	to the east of the continent--those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
8505	69	20	countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
8506	72	22	ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal generations, when the memory of
8507	71	19	the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants,
8508	72	23	unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of
8509	72	19	the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end; when though,
8510	71	22	according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of
8511	70	22	men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane
8512	7	3	amours.

8519	68	20	Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
8520	72	21	swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the
8521	68	20	Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the
8522	69	21	Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality,
8523	26	7	southerly from St. Helena.

8525	68	21	It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
8526	69	17	moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
8527	67	19	and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
8528	70	22	silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
8529	70	20	far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it
8530	69	23	looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
8531	65	19	the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight
8532	67	18	nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a
8533	71	23	look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
8534	72	21	though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred
8535	68	21	would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions,
8536	71	23	then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual
8537	70	20	hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after
8538	65	20	spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights
8539	66	20	without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his
8540	70	22	unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every
8541	66	21	reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had
8542	70	18	lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. "There she blows!"
8543	71	20	Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet
8544	68	19	still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most
8545	64	20	unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
8546	65	21	exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
8547	9	3	lowering.

8549	69	19	Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
8550	68	19	t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The
8551	67	17	best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head
8552	68	18	manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,
8553	70	21	upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
8554	66	22	of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
8555	70	22	beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
8556	69	22	influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct to heaven, the
8557	68	22	other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched
8558	67	20	Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
8559	72	23	different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes
8560	72	22	along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap.
8561	69	18	On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly
8562	69	20	sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot,
8563	70	21	yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every sailor swore he
8564	35	11	saw it once, but not a second time.
8565	0	0	
8566	71	18	This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
8567	68	24	after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it
8568	70	23	was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
8569	68	22	disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
8570	62	19	night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously
8571	68	19	jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;
8572	72	24	disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow
8573	70	22	seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and
8574	69	22	further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.

8576	69	24	Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
8577	71	20	with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested
8578	64	21	the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
8579	70	24	whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however
8580	66	22	far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast
8581	68	19	by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there
8582	68	24	reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition,
8583	69	22	as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the
8584	69	19	monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
8585	21	7	and most savage seas.

8587	72	25	These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
8588	71	20	potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
8589	70	20	all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as
8590	71	22	for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely
8591	66	21	mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed
8592	49	17	vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.
8593	0	0	
8594	72	19	But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling
8595	69	22	around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
8596	67	18	there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and
8597	72	19	gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips,
8598	70	21	the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity
8599	68	21	of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.

8601	71	20	Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
8602	71	23	before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
8603	71	20	every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
8604	69	21	spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
8605	72	22	as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing
8606	67	24	appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their
8607	68	21	homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the
8608	72	23	black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane
8609	70	22	soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had
8610	5	1	bred.

8612	69	22	Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called
8613	68	22	of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
8614	65	22	attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea,
8615	71	21	where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed
8616	70	22	condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat
8617	72	20	that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying;
8618	71	20	still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us
8619	60	19	on from before, the solitary jet would at times be descried.
8620	0	0	
8621	72	20	During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the
8622	69	21	time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
8623	69	23	manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed
8624	70	24	his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and
8625	71	24	aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await
8626	72	23	the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists.
8627	70	22	So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one
8628	67	18	hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand
8629	68	22	gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow
8630	69	22	would all but congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew
8631	66	18	driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that
8632	69	20	burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in
8633	70	22	the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man
8634	72	22	had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which
8635	68	20	he swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the
8636	71	21	silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore
8637	68	19	on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.
8638	64	19	By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the
8639	70	21	ocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still
8640	68	23	wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed
8641	68	22	demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never
8642	69	18	could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night going down
8643	63	19	into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with
8644	65	19	closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain
8645	69	20	and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
8646	70	19	emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the
8647	71	22	table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
8648	72	19	which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly
8649	69	17	clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so
8650	69	22	that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale
8651	39	11	that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*

8654	72	23	*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the

8667	71	21	South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
8668	69	22	ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)
8669	60	12	by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
8670	71	23	fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
8671	71	23	in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
8672	0	0	
8673	66	19	As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
8674	64	17	skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
8675	72	21	appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her
8676	71	20	spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
8677	70	19	with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to
8678	69	23	see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed
8679	71	19	clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had
8680	72	24	survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to
8681	71	19	the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when
8682	67	19	the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air
8683	68	21	came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the
8684	72	22	mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking
8685	72	22	fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
8686	66	21	look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
8687	0	0	
8688	42	13	"Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?"
8689	0	0	
8690	72	21	But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
8691	70	19	act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
8692	70	23	into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make
8693	68	21	himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the
8694	71	25	distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod
8695	68	23	were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first
8696	66	22	mere mention of the White Whale's name to another ship, Ahab for a
8697	70	25	moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat
8698	71	20	to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking
8699	68	23	advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and
8700	68	18	knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and
8701	70	21	shortly bound home, he loudly hailed--"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod,
8702	69	19	bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters to the
8703	72	23	Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them
8704	21	5	to address them to--"
8705	0	0	
8706	70	18	At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
8707	70	19	in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
8708	72	21	that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted
8709	69	20	away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and
8710	69	19	aft with the stranger's flanks. Though in the course of his continual
8711	70	23	voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to
8712	68	22	any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
8713	0	0	
8714	70	21	"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
8715	72	23	There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
8716	69	21	helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But
8717	71	19	turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
8718	70	23	wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,--"Up
8719	36	9	helm! Keep her off round the world!"
8720	0	0	
8721	71	21	Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
8722	64	20	but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
8723	71	20	numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
8724	51	17	we left behind secure, were all the time before us.
8725	0	0	
8726	70	20	Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
8727	68	20	ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
8728	69	20	than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
8729	71	23	in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
8730	69	20	tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
8731	71	21	before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
8732	61	21	either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.

8739	71	22	The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
8740	64	18	spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had
8741	69	21	this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
8742	69	21	her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it
8743	68	22	had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative
8744	67	22	answer to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he
8745	71	21	cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain,
8746	69	23	except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly
8747	66	22	sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not
8748	66	22	something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when
8749	62	22	meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common
8750	16	5	cruising-ground.

8752	68	18	If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
8753	69	24	equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
8754	67	21	each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
8755	70	23	them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment
8756	63	17	to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while
8757	65	18	and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
8758	69	22	illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling
8759	63	18	vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off lone
8760	70	18	Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more natural,
8761	64	17	I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
8762	64	19	interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
8763	66	22	sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of
8764	72	24	course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains,
8765	70	21	officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other;
8766	71	21	and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.
8767	0	0	
8768	70	19	For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
8769	69	22	board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
8770	72	21	date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn
8771	68	20	files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would
8772	67	22	receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to
8773	71	20	which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And
8774	70	19	in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing
8775	66	19	each other's track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they
8776	70	24	are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have received a
8777	67	18	transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and
8778	70	21	some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets.
8779	68	22	Besides, they would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable
8780	70	19	chat. For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors,
8781	71	26	but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common
8782	50	16	pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.
8783	0	0	
8784	67	22	Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
8785	67	22	that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
8786	72	20	with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of
8787	69	18	English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they
8788	72	22	do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your
8789	70	21	Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that
8790	66	17	sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers
8791	69	26	sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American
8792	67	18	whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript
8793	68	23	provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority
8794	69	20	in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say,
8795	71	22	seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than
8796	67	18	all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless
8797	70	21	little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does
8798	68	20	not take much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few
8799	16	5	foibles himself.
8800	0	0	
8801	66	20	So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
8802	71	24	whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so. Whereas, some
8803	67	18	merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
8804	67	22	oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
8805	72	24	mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in
8806	72	22	Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon
8807	69	20	each other's rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea,
8808	72	16	they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such
8809	68	19	a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down
8810	64	20	hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching
8811	71	20	Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run
8812	71	22	away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they
8813	70	18	chance to cross each other's cross-bones, the first hail is--"How many
8814	70	16	skulls?"--the same way that whalers hail--"How many barrels?" And that
8815	69	23	question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are
8816	71	23	infernal villains on both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of each
8817	29	10	other's villanous likenesses.
8818	0	0	
8819	68	23	But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
8820	68	21	free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
8821	65	18	whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a "GAM," a thing so
8822	68	19	utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
8823	72	19	even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and
8824	70	22	repeat gamesome stuff about "spouters" and "blubber-boilers," and such
8825	70	20	like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also
8826	70	19	all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such
8827	70	22	a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be
8828	70	23	hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to
8829	67	21	know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about
8830	68	23	it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the
8831	72	22	gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has
8832	66	24	no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude,
8833	68	21	that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that
8834	52	17	assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.

8836	70	22	But what is a GAM? You might wear out your index-finger running up and
8837	70	19	down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson
8838	70	23	never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not hold it.
8839	70	21	Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in
8840	70	23	constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly,
8841	72	25	it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With
8842	38	12	that view, let me learnedly define it.

8844	71	23	GAM. NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY ON A
8845	70	19	CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY
8846	71	22	BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON BOARD OF ONE
8847	43	12	SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.
8848	0	0	
8849	70	22	There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
8850	71	26	here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
8851	67	19	has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when
8852	70	21	the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
8853	66	23	sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often
8854	68	19	steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with
8855	72	21	gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of
8856	71	20	that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling
8857	72	25	captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen
8858	69	21	in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of
8859	71	22	any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew
8860	70	24	must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of
8861	68	22	the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and
8862	66	20	the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit
8863	67	22	all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being
8864	68	21	conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from
8865	69	20	the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the
8866	68	21	importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is
8867	68	20	this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting
8868	67	18	steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
8869	65	19	after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus
8870	64	18	completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself
8871	70	18	sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
8872	68	20	pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
8873	66	22	foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a
8874	69	20	spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,
8875	70	21	it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would
8876	65	19	never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
8877	64	15	himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with
8878	67	20	his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he
8879	71	19	generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being
8880	69	19	generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.
8881	72	25	Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too,
8882	69	21	where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or
8883	67	21	two, in a sudden squall say--to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's
8884	40	12	hair, and hold on there like grim death.

8898	58	17	It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
8899	70	21	homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned
8900	67	18	almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave
8901	70	20	us strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White
8902	66	18	Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho's
8903	65	20	story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
8904	72	24	wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God
8905	71	23	which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance,
8906	70	20	with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the
8907	71	23	secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears
8908	67	19	of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was
8909	65	19	unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private
8910	72	23	property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it
8911	70	22	seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy,
8912	67	20	but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed
8913	69	19	so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well
8914	70	19	withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing
8915	68	23	have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of
8916	72	20	it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in
8917	72	19	this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
8918	67	21	transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving in its proper
8919	67	18	place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the
8920	70	21	ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting
8921	7	2	record.

8928	72	20	For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated
8929	72	22	it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve,
8930	68	20	smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those
8931	71	23	fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer
8932	68	21	terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally
8933	45	13	put, and which are duly answered at the time.

8935	70	21	"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
8936	69	20	rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
8937	68	21	was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward
8938	64	20	from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the
8939	72	20	northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to
8940	70	22	daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than
8941	70	18	common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the
8942	69	25	captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck
8943	71	26	awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit
8944	70	21	them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though,
8945	67	19	indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down
8946	69	21	as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her
8947	72	21	cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals;
8948	71	19	but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet
8949	68	20	undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking
8950	68	22	some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest
8951	71	23	harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
8952	0	0	
8953	69	20	"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
8954	72	21	favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,
8955	70	24	because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at
8956	70	20	them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;
8957	68	19	never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the
8958	68	21	whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the
8959	67	19	Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port
8960	69	22	without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the
8961	70	22	brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly
8962	70	24	provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.

8967	62	22	"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your
8968	63	18	courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
8969	68	19	gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
8970	69	24	large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
8971	71	23	Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet
8972	69	24	been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
8973	67	22	connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,
8974	72	23	those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
8975	71	23	Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
8976	67	21	of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
8977	72	24	races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
8978	72	22	even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great
8979	67	20	contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime
8980	69	26	approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted
8981	68	21	all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries,
8982	71	19	and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the
8983	68	21	fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their
8984	66	21	beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out
8985	68	22	their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient
8986	69	22	and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines
8987	69	23	of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric
8988	67	21	beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes
8989	65	20	to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and
8990	62	20	Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the
8991	71	20	full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,
8992	70	20	and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as
8993	72	19	direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are,
8994	69	19	for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many
8995	68	17	a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though
8996	68	21	an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;
8997	69	23	as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his
8998	71	22	infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse
8999	66	22	at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our
9000	68	25	austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as
9001	66	21	vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh
9002	66	19	from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. Yet was this
9003	68	22	Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
9004	67	20	mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
9005	67	19	firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
9006	68	18	which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had
9007	68	21	long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved
9008	68	19	so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,
9009	26	8	gentlemen, you shall hear.
9010	0	0	
9011	65	19	"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing
9012	67	20	her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again
9013	66	22	increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
9014	71	24	every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
9015	72	21	Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole
9016	69	19	way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of
9017	67	18	the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability
9018	68	22	would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on
9019	63	17	account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the
9020	71	22	solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it
9021	70	22	altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in
9022	72	23	full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie
9023	70	25	along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat
9024	71	22	is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of
9025	69	20	the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her
9026	40	15	captain begins to feel a little anxious.
9027	0	0	
9028	71	19	"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
9029	70	21	gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
9030	67	20	several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded
9031	68	22	the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
9032	70	22	expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a
9033	70	22	coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
9034	71	22	touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
9035	67	23	on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when
9036	69	23	he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
9037	72	23	seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in
9038	70	19	her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on
9039	72	21	this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood
9040	67	20	with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water;
9041	69	18	clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps
9042	70	22	ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
9043	14	4	scupper-holes.
9044	0	0	
9045	70	21	"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
9046	72	21	world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command
9047	66	19	over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
9048	69	23	superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
9049	67	24	conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a
9050	66	18	chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and
9051	68	22	make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,
9052	69	21	gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
9053	72	24	head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings
9054	70	20	of your last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and
9055	70	21	a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he
9056	69	19	been born son to Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly
9057	67	21	as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love
9058	33	9	Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.
9059	0	0	
9060	69	20	"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
9061	70	21	rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
9062	19	5	his gay banterings.
9063	0	0	
9064	72	20	"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one
9065	71	17	of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth bottling! I tell
9066	71	18	ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best cut away
9067	72	17	his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish
9068	72	20	only began the job; he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,
9069	65	17	saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of 'em
9070	63	17	are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making
9071	71	21	improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump
9072	71	21	overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his estate, I
9073	71	20	can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,--Rad, and a beauty too. Boys,
9074	67	19	they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I
9075	64	21	wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'

9077	64	16	"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,
9078	69	20	pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk. 'Thunder away at it!'
9079	0	0	
9080	68	18	"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys,
9081	69	18	lively, now!' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;
9082	71	21	the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
9083	66	19	of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's
9084	16	6	utmost energies.

9086	71	18	"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
9087	67	17	forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
9088	68	20	fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his
9089	70	19	brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney
9090	71	22	to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know
9091	70	20	not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate
9092	66	19	commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
9093	72	25	shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig
9094	16	5	to run at large.

9096	70	23	"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household
9097	71	21	work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
9098	67	21	evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
9099	64	20	foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
9100	71	25	sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
9101	71	19	would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
9102	69	20	vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,
9103	72	21	if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho
9104	70	19	that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being
9105	66	20	the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly
9106	65	21	assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have
9107	70	22	been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical
9108	66	21	duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these
9109	68	21	particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood
9110	20	6	between the two men.

9112	71	21	"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
9113	70	19	plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat
9114	61	19	in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
9115	72	19	understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully
9116	71	20	comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for
9117	72	23	a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and
9118	72	20	perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match
9119	64	17	silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all
9120	70	21	this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper
9121	72	24	passionateness in any already ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when
9122	69	20	felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless
9123	49	15	phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.

9125	68	20	"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
9126	70	23	exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
9127	72	20	the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without
9128	72	22	at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary
9129	66	19	sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or
9130	64	18	nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most
9131	65	26	domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
9132	67	21	command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an
9133	72	19	uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.

9135	71	21	"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
9136	68	22	all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt
9137	63	19	could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still
9138	69	23	smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained
9139	71	21	doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the
9140	70	22	hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
9141	12	3	his bidding.
9142	0	0	
9143	67	19	"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
9144	72	23	followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his
9145	68	23	intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not
9146	69	21	the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his
9147	72	22	twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to
9148	72	19	no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;
9149	71	20	when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had
9150	71	22	now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on
9151	42	12	the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
9152	0	0	
9153	68	20	"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
9154	71	21	yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
9155	69	21	the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
9156	69	24	his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
9157	70	20	Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
9158	64	17	with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching
9159	66	16	his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
9160	71	21	persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would
9161	71	20	murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter
9162	71	20	by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant
9163	69	20	the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
9164	28	10	spouting blood like a whale.
9165	0	0	
9166	68	19	"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
9167	66	21	leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
9168	36	10	mastheads. They were both Canallers.

9172	6	1	they?'

9185	70	23	breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and
9186	69	18	most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
9187	71	22	affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room
9188	67	20	and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman
9189	68	19	arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or
9190	70	20	broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk
9191	69	20	counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
9192	70	23	stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly
9193	70	22	corrupt and often lawless life. There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen;
9194	67	21	there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
9195	70	19	under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.
9196	71	25	For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
9197	65	21	freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so
9198	54	18	sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.

9208	66	23	no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima
9209	70	22	for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
9210	65	18	surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast--"Corrupt as
9211	70	22	Lima." It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
9212	67	20	billiard-tables, and for ever open--and "Corrupt as Lima." So, too,
9213	71	21	Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.

9217	72	23	"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make
9218	72	24	a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like
9219	68	18	Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile,
9220	67	20	he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra,
9221	68	19	ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this
9222	72	22	effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly
9223	71	21	sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.
9224	66	20	A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he
9225	70	21	floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.
9226	72	25	Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of
9227	68	21	these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful;
9228	67	25	but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of
9229	70	21	violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger
9230	69	20	in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the
9231	69	19	wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this; that
9232	71	22	our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates,
9233	67	18	and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much
9234	67	20	distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish the
9235	72	22	curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and
9236	71	22	young men born along its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal
9237	68	24	furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian
9238	68	18	corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric
9239	5	2	seas.

9241	69	23	"'I see! I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha
9242	69	20	upon his silvery ruffles. 'No need to travel! The world's one Lima. I
9243	72	22	had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold
9244	39	8	and holy as the hills.--But the story.'
9245	0	0	
9246	68	18	"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly
9247	72	22	had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the
9248	71	20	four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the
9249	72	23	ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and
9250	72	22	sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the
9251	71	22	sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued;
9252	72	21	while standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down
9253	72	24	with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
9254	72	21	scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran
9255	66	20	close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into
9256	68	20	the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his
9257	68	21	resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them
9258	66	20	all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily
9259	68	21	slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass,
9260	63	21	these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
9261	0	0	
9262	70	22	"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing them
9263	69	18	with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. 'Come
9264	29	8	out of that, ye cut-throats!'
9265	0	0	
9266	67	20	"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
9267	62	19	defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
9268	71	18	understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the signal
9269	69	21	for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart
9270	70	21	lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but
9271	65	17	still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
9272	0	0	
9273	61	19	"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their
9274	11	4	ringleader.

9276	69	20	"'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty! Do you want to
9277	68	17	sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!' and he
9278	26	10	once more raised a pistol.
9279	0	0	
9280	70	18	"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt. 'Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
9281	72	23	turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say
9282	69	21	ye, men?' turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
9283	0	0	
9284	71	23	"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
9285	71	21	on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--'It's not our
9286	68	19	fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was
9287	69	19	boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to
9288	68	24	prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his
9289	68	20	cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,
9290	68	20	men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to
9291	68	20	yourself; say the word; don't be a fool; forget it all; we are ready
9292	66	18	to turn to; treat us decently, and we're your men; but we won't be
9293	9	2	flogged.'

9295	47	13	"'Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!'
9296	0	0	
9297	69	19	"'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
9298	67	22	'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped
9299	69	21	for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
9300	69	19	discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's
9301	71	24	not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we
9302	18	4	won't be flogged.'
9303	0	0	
9304	31	9	"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.
9305	0	0	
9306	71	20	"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell you what
9307	70	18	it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
9308	69	19	rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till
9309	67	18	you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's turn.'
9310	0	0	
9311	70	19	"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till
9312	30	8	ye're sick of it. Down ye go.'
9313	0	0	
9314	71	20	"'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
9315	68	20	it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down
9316	69	22	into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
9317	0	0	
9318	71	20	"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
9319	70	22	and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
9320	71	20	of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
9321	65	17	for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
9322	13	5	companionway.
9323	0	0	
9324	65	20	"Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something
9325	63	16	down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in
9326	70	21	number--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained
9327	8	3	neutral.
9328	0	0	
9329	71	19	"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
9330	72	22	aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which
9331	68	21	last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking
9332	70	21	through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace;
9333	67	19	the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps,
9334	65	17	whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night
9335	36	10	dismally resounded through the ship.
9336	0	0	
9337	72	20	"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
9338	67	18	the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then
9339	69	22	lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
9340	68	20	after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the
9341	68	21	Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days
9342	70	20	this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and
9343	71	20	then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and
9344	70	20	suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready
9345	72	23	to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united
9346	70	24	perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to
9347	71	23	surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his
9348	70	21	demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to
9349	68	19	stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth
9350	69	22	morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
9351	72	21	desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
9352	0	0	
9353	63	18	"'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.

9357	50	13	"'Oh certainly,' the Captain, and the key clicked.
9358	0	0	
9359	72	21	"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven
9360	70	20	of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last
9361	70	20	hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as
9362	69	20	the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two
9363	68	19	Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of
9364	70	21	their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their
9365	69	19	keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle
9366	71	19	at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any
9367	69	22	devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he
9368	68	19	would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the
9369	66	16	last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no
9370	71	22	opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for
9371	72	18	that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.
9372	71	20	And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck,
9373	71	22	when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as
9374	71	21	fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as
9375	70	21	his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter;
9376	71	20	and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one
9377	69	21	man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants
9378	14	5	must come out.
9379	0	0	
9380	66	21	"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
9381	70	24	separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
9382	68	22	of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
9383	69	18	the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
9384	72	20	thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit.
9385	69	21	But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to
9386	70	18	the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed
9387	63	22	their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader
9388	68	23	fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three
9389	71	18	sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords;
9390	45	14	and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
9391	0	0	
9392	72	18	"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and
9393	67	22	all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a
9394	71	20	few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
9395	66	21	struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
9396	69	24	allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been
9397	69	20	fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along
9398	69	22	the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the
9399	69	20	mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
9400	69	19	morning. 'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,
9401	47	14	'the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!'
9402	0	0	
9403	72	22	"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled
9404	71	19	from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that
9405	67	19	he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon the whole,
9406	70	21	he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for the present,
9407	63	19	considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a
9408	63	19	reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.

9410	69	21	"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the
9411	64	17	rigging--'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;' and,
9412	68	20	seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
9413	71	20	two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
9414	49	16	sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
9415	0	0	
9416	71	17	"'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is still

9418	70	18	that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.'

9425	72	19	"'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew off with
9426	19	6	the rope to strike.
9427	0	0	
9428	32	8	"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.
9429	0	0	
9430	69	18	"'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
9431	0	0	
9432	71	24	"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
9433	72	19	who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly
9434	70	19	two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, 'I
9435	50	12	won't do it--let him go--cut him down: d'ye hear?'
9436	0	0	
9437	72	24	"But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,
9438	70	22	with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate. Ever since
9439	72	19	the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult
9440	65	17	on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole
9441	67	18	scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak;
9442	70	21	but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the
9443	67	20	captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his
9444	13	6	pinioned foe.
9445	0	0	
9446	40	13	"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.
9447	0	0	
9448	68	18	"'So I am, but take that.' The mate was in the very act of striking,
9449	70	21	when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing
9450	71	21	no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat, whatever that
9451	72	20	might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned
9452	71	19	to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as
9453	7	3	before.
9454	0	0	
9455	69	19	"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
9456	71	20	was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
9457	69	19	besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
9458	71	20	Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
9459	70	19	instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation. Still, no
9460	69	21	sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,
9461	69	22	that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain
9462	70	19	the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
9463	67	20	ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the
9464	70	22	speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing--namely,
9465	66	20	not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,
9466	71	20	spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still
9467	65	20	maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to
9468	70	17	lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
9469	69	22	cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
9470	70	21	berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
9471	23	7	vital jaw of the whale.
9472	0	0	
9473	68	21	"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
9474	72	21	passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all
9475	72	22	was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
9476	72	20	had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief
9477	66	20	mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than
9478	71	21	half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted,
9479	66	22	against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head
9480	69	19	of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances,
9481	55	16	Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
9482	0	0	
9483	67	20	"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
9484	69	21	bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
9485	68	21	the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.
9486	68	21	In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a
9487	68	21	considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
9488	72	21	this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next
9489	72	20	trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the
9490	66	19	third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure,
9491	68	21	he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his
9492	14	4	watches below.

9499	0	0	
9500	67	17	"'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length
9501	67	20	before him; 'but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven't enough
9502	22	7	twine,--have you any?'
9503	0	0	
9504	38	12	"But there was none in the forecastle.

9510	72	17	"'Why not? Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help himself
9511	62	19	in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at him
9512	71	21	quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given
9513	66	20	him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night
9514	66	17	an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the
9515	72	21	Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for
9516	69	18	a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm--nigh
9517	65	20	to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to
9518	63	18	the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to come; and in the
9519	64	21	fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and
9520	52	15	stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.

9525	69	21	to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
9526	5	2	done.

9529	72	19	day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,
9530	69	22	drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, 'There she
9531	62	15	rolls! there she rolls!' Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.

9547	64	19	"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen,
9548	64	17	so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
9549	71	20	ship--forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of the
9550	68	21	moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
9551	71	22	his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
9552	71	18	plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
9553	68	18	'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from captain, mates,
9554	69	24	and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious
9555	68	23	to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed
9556	70	19	askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
9557	69	19	that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like
9558	68	22	a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality
9559	66	22	pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
9560	72	21	before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the
9561	69	18	mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while
9562	66	19	Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken
9563	68	21	the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were
9564	69	20	lowered, the mate's got the start; and none howled more fiercely with
9565	68	20	delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff
9566	69	19	pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to
9567	70	22	the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his
9568	67	17	bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's topmost back. Nothing
9569	69	20	loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that
9570	67	19	blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as
9571	72	23	against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.
9572	72	18	That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted,
9573	72	21	and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the
9574	70	19	sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray,
9575	72	19	and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to
9576	68	20	remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round
9577	71	22	in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing
9578	56	15	high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
9579	0	0	
9580	65	19	"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had
9581	67	18	slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
9582	64	18	looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,
9583	71	20	downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He
9584	69	20	cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose
9585	69	20	again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught in the
9586	70	22	teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the
9587	50	15	whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
9588	0	0	
9589	63	20	"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary
9590	64	22	place--where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the
9591	69	23	Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
9592	69	23	among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
9593	65	21	war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
9594	0	0	
9595	70	20	"The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
9596	69	24	upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
9597	68	20	down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over
9598	71	22	their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
9599	69	16	by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
9600	67	22	that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
9601	69	21	weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
9602	71	22	heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
9603	68	21	ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
9604	63	16	from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the
9605	68	21	Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
9606	66	19	him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
9607	68	22	before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
9608	26	8	reinforcement to his crew.
9609	0	0	
9610	72	23	"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed
9611	69	23	to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but
9612	66	21	the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt
9613	68	23	hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain
9614	71	23	presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes,
9615	68	20	the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so
9616	67	18	much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.

9618	45	13	"'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.

9624	0	0	
9625	70	22	"'Very good. Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.' With that he
9626	72	22	leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood
9627	30	10	face to face with the captain.
9628	0	0	
9629	67	18	"'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me.
9630	68	23	As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
9631	68	19	island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike
9632	4	1	me!'
9633	0	0	
9634	69	20	"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman. 'Adios, Senor!' and leaping
9635	43	13	into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.

9637	66	18	"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
9638	72	26	roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time
9639	71	24	arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended
9640	69	22	him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially
9641	69	20	in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They
9642	71	21	embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he
9643	50	16	been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
9644	0	0	
9645	69	20	"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
9646	63	21	and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
9647	68	22	Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small
9648	69	20	native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
9649	41	13	right there, again resumed his cruisings.

9697	48	13	CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.

9699	0	0	
9700	64	21	I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
9701	71	23	something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
9702	69	23	eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
9703	69	21	alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
9704	63	20	It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those
9705	69	22	curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
9706	70	20	confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the
9707	69	17	world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all
9708	6	1	wrong.
9709	0	0	
9710	70	23	It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
9711	71	22	be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For
9712	68	23	ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
9713	64	18	panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
9714	63	17	medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
9715	71	23	chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St. George's; ever
9716	67	21	since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
9717	66	20	only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
9718	21	7	presentations of him.
9719	0	0	
9720	72	19	Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to
9721	72	24	be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,
9722	72	22	in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
9723	70	24	that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable
9724	71	26	avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
9725	69	22	into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of
9726	63	20	whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale
9727	71	22	referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the
9728	70	22	incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the
9729	70	20	Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so
9730	72	21	as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is
9731	72	23	all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the
9732	48	14	broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.
9733	0	0	
9734	72	23	But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter's
9735	70	22	portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
9736	68	24	Hindoo. It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the
9737	69	22	sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange
9738	69	22	creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his
9739	71	23	own "Perseus Descending," make out one whit better. The huge corpulence
9740	69	21	of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing
9741	63	18	one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its
9742	67	19	distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be
9743	70	21	taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the
9744	70	19	Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and
9745	70	19	Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of
9746	72	20	old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder's whale
9747	68	20	winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as
9748	66	18	stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both
9749	69	23	old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,
9750	60	22	imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.
9751	66	21	Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this
9752	68	22	book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended
9753	65	19	when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old
9754	70	23	Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival
9755	64	20	of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively
9756	68	23	late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the
9757	10	4	Leviathan.

9759	72	23	In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
9760	70	23	at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner
9761	70	20	of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden,
9762	69	22	come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the
9763	68	24	original edition of the "Advancement of Learning" you will find some
9764	15	6	curious whales.

9766	70	22	But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
9767	70	25	pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
9768	71	22	by those who know. In old Harris's collection of voyages there are some
9769	67	18	plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
9770	66	20	entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the
9771	71	22	Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master." In one of those plates the
9772	72	22	whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles,
9773	71	21	with white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the
9774	71	24	prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
9775	7	2	flukes.
9776	0	0	
9777	72	23	Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett,
9778	70	22	a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage round Cape Horn
9779	70	23	into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale
9780	69	24	Fisheries." In this book is an outline purporting to be a "Picture of
9781	69	20	a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the
9782	68	20	coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck." I doubt not the
9783	72	25	captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines.
9784	70	22	To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which
9785	67	19	applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm
9786	67	23	whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet
9787	70	20	long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out
9788	12	4	of that eye!

9790	66	23	Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for
9791	70	23	the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
9792	72	22	mistake. Look at that popular work "Goldsmith's Animated Nature." In the
9793	71	23	abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged "whale"
9794	69	20	and a "narwhale." I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly
9795	69	22	whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one
9796	69	23	glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century
9797	66	22	such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent
9798	21	6	public of schoolboys.
9799	0	0	
9800	65	20	Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great
9801	69	24	naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
9802	69	23	several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these
9803	70	21	are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland
9804	62	16	whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long
9805	66	22	experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
9806	22	8	counterpart in nature.
9807	0	0	
9808	68	19	But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
9809	67	22	reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
9810	69	19	Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he
9811	69	20	gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that
9812	65	21	picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
9813	72	21	retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not
9814	67	21	a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of
9815	67	20	a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that
9816	70	21	picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
9817	70	23	in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that
9818	72	19	is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil
9819	57	19	those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.

9821	69	20	As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the
9822	68	20	shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
9823	72	21	Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting
9824	67	21	on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners:
9825	62	22	their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.
9826	0	0	
9827	66	21	But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
9828	68	20	surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have
9829	70	22	been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
9830	70	18	drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
9831	68	20	the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
9832	72	21	Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan
9833	72	21	has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,
9834	66	21	in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
9835	69	21	unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,
9836	68	23	like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a
9837	70	21	thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the
9838	70	20	air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not
9839	71	24	to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young
9840	68	21	sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the
9841	72	22	case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such
9842	70	21	is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that
9843	57	17	his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.
9844	0	0	
9845	67	19	But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
9846	72	22	whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all.
9847	67	23	For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that
9848	71	23	his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy
9849	71	20	Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of
9850	71	24	his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian
9851	72	21	old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics;
9852	63	18	yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's
9853	71	22	articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton
9854	69	22	of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded
9855	71	22	animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes
9856	66	21	it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some
9857	71	21	part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously
9858	70	20	displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to
9859	68	18	the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four
9860	69	19	regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But
9861	71	21	all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
9862	68	21	fingers in an artificial covering. "However recklessly the whale may
9863	72	23	sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be truly
9864	35	11	said to handle us without mittens."
9865	0	0	
9866	71	22	For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
9867	67	22	conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world
9868	67	21	which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit
9869	68	19	the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
9870	71	23	considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding
9871	68	21	out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in
9872	68	25	which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is
9873	70	19	by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
9874	72	22	being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had
9875	69	25	best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.

9883	65	19	In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
9884	64	21	tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of
9885	69	21	them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
9886	71	19	especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
9887	15	3	that matter by.
9888	0	0	
9889	64	20	I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
9890	70	20	Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's. In the previous
9891	66	20	chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins's is far
9892	72	19	better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale's is the best. All Beale's
9893	67	21	drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the
9894	64	22	picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second
9895	66	19	chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no
9896	70	23	doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
9897	72	22	admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm
9898	72	19	Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they
9899	54	15	are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.
9900	0	0	
9901	71	21	Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
9902	71	24	are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
9903	72	24	but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because
9904	71	20	it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive
9905	71	22	anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
9906	8	2	hunters.
9907	0	0	
9908	68	19	But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
9909	67	19	not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
9910	66	20	be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,
9911	69	19	and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
9912	68	18	attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble
9913	68	19	Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
9914	72	24	the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air
9915	66	17	upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of
9916	64	19	the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon
9917	67	17	the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
9918	71	22	incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
9919	69	22	incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
9920	71	22	from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
9921	70	23	true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
9922	67	21	poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
9923	70	22	swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
9924	72	19	of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
9925	72	25	upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
9926	72	20	of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not
9927	19	7	draw so good a one.
9928	0	0	
9929	68	21	In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
9930	72	18	the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black
9931	68	22	weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian
9932	70	18	cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so
9933	71	23	abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave
9934	70	22	supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the
9935	71	19	small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the
9936	70	21	Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while
9937	71	21	the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
9938	71	22	tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock
9939	68	20	in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean
9940	69	21	steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in
9941	71	22	admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the
9942	70	20	drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of
9943	67	21	a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily
9944	57	18	hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.

9946	69	19	Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
9947	72	21	was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously
9948	65	20	tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for
9949	66	23	painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and
9950	68	21	where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion
9951	70	21	on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder
9952	67	18	fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of
9953	71	18	France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the
9954	69	20	successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned
9955	71	21	centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea
9956	25	8	battle-pieces of Garnery.

9958	69	23	The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
9959	70	21	things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
9960	66	18	they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England's
9961	69	20	experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
9962	70	21	Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
9963	64	20	finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of
9964	65	18	the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale
9965	72	23	draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline
9966	68	18	of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as
9967	72	24	picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching
9968	66	18	the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right
9969	69	19	whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale,
9970	72	26	and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats
9971	70	22	us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives,
9972	65	21	and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck
9973	72	22	submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of
9974	72	22	magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement to the excellent
9975	69	23	voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it
9976	67	20	was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
9977	62	22	sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.
9978	0	0	
9979	70	23	In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
9980	68	18	French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
9981	69	20	"H. Durand." One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
9982	71	25	purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet
9983	68	21	noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,
9984	72	23	inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails
9985	69	18	of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both
9986	70	22	drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when
9987	69	21	considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under
9988	67	23	one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is
9989	72	25	quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the
9990	69	22	very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the
9991	69	21	vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a
9992	71	21	quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is
9993	69	22	about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances
9994	68	22	lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
9995	66	18	hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
9996	69	21	half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the
9997	69	22	smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
9998	69	21	over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
9999	71	22	with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the
10000	15	6	excited seamen.

10008	70	22	On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
10009	71	21	crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the sailors say) holding a painted board
10010	67	19	before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg.
10011	70	23	There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed
10012	66	21	to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being
10013	69	19	crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years,
10014	67	18	they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that
10015	68	22	stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification has
10016	71	24	now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in
10017	72	23	Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you
10018	67	19	will find in the western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on
10019	71	20	that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with
10020	64	19	downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.

10022	67	20	Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and

10024	72	19	whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth,
10025	63	19	or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other
10026	68	21	like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous little
10027	72	27	ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material,
10028	63	23	in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little boxes
10029	61	19	of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
10030	63	18	skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their
10031	71	22	jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,
10032	69	22	they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner's

10035	70	24	Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
10036	72	21	to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery.
10037	72	26	Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a
10038	72	23	savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready
10039	35	11	at any moment to rebel against him.

10041	70	24	Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
10042	65	23	hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian
10043	69	22	war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
10044	71	23	carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.
10045	64	17	For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth, that
10046	69	24	miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
10047	40	13	cost steady years of steady application.

10049	70	24	As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
10050	68	21	same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark's tooth, of
10051	71	23	his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not
10052	68	22	quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design,
10053	67	20	as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield; and full of barbaric spirit
10054	71	20	and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert
10055	6	2	Durer.

10057	70	21	Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
10058	72	23	the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles
10059	62	20	of American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.

10061	70	23	At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
10062	66	19	by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is
10063	64	19	sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking
10064	70	23	whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some
10065	70	23	old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
10066	68	22	weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
10067	69	21	intents and purposes so labelled with "HANDS OFF!" you cannot examine
10068	47	16	them closely enough to decide upon their merit.

10070	69	20	In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
10071	64	18	cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the
10072	70	23	plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
10073	69	19	Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against
10074	31	9	them in a surf of green surges.

10076	72	26	Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
10077	66	19	girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky
10078	64	19	point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of
10079	70	23	whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough
10080	65	18	whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you wish
10081	68	22	to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the exact
10082	67	22	intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point, else
10083	69	22	so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your precise,
10084	69	26	previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery; like the
10085	69	21	Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed
10086	51	15	Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.

10088	70	21	Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
10089	68	20	great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as
10090	68	20	when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies
10091	66	19	locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased
10092	69	22	Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright
10093	72	21	points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic
10094	69	24	skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the
10095	67	15	starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying
10096	5	1	Fish.

10098	71	19	With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
10099	68	20	spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to
10100	72	22	see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie
10101	32	8	encamped beyond my mortal sight!

10108	71	19	Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
10109	65	18	of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
10110	72	25	largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we
10111	71	23	seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.
10112	0	0	
10113	70	20	On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
10114	71	20	the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
10115	69	17	swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
10116	69	22	wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
10117	39	11	from the water that escaped at the lip.

10119	65	18	As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
10120	71	18	their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
10121	67	17	monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving
10122	56	16	behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*

10125	69	19	*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the "Brazil Banks" does
10126	68	22	not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
10127	66	21	being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
10128	69	22	meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
10129	67	21	floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.

10131	0	0	
10132	72	19	But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
10133	70	21	reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
10134	69	22	paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked
10135	67	20	more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the
10136	65	21	great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will
10137	69	21	sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
10138	72	23	to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even
10139	71	19	so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species of the
10140	70	23	leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their immense
10141	71	21	magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses
10142	72	18	of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort
10143	39	13	of life that lives in a dog or a horse.
10144	0	0	
10145	69	21	Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
10146	70	22	deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though
10147	71	25	some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
10148	67	22	of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of
10149	71	19	the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for
10150	71	23	example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
10151	70	22	the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any
10152	59	21	generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
10153	0	0	
10154	65	20	But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the
10155	67	25	seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
10156	71	23	repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
10157	70	21	so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
10158	68	20	one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific
10159	71	24	of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
10160	70	21	tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;
10161	69	21	though but a moment's consideration will teach, that however baby man
10162	68	19	may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
10163	70	21	future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,
10164	71	21	to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize
10165	66	19	the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
10166	71	23	continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
10167	66	20	of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.

10169	68	23	The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
10170	71	23	vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
10171	70	21	That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
10172	69	21	of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided;
10173	43	11	two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.

10175	69	23	Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
10176	70	22	miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
10177	67	21	when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened
10178	70	20	and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
10179	67	19	precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.

10181	71	23	But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
10182	70	20	is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
10183	68	19	murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
10184	70	21	spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
10185	72	21	own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks,
10186	69	18	and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No
10187	72	19	mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad
10188	71	21	battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the
10189	6	2	globe.

10191	72	23	Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
10192	67	20	under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden
10193	64	22	beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
10194	68	21	brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
10195	72	22	dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,
10196	72	25	the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each
10197	53	15	other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.

10199	71	19	Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
10200	70	20	earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
10201	69	22	strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
10202	72	23	surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
10203	72	21	Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the
10204	71	19	half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst
10205	13	4	never return!

10211	71	19	Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
10212	69	21	way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling
10213	69	21	her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
10214	67	19	masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a
10215	69	18	plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
10216	27	9	alluring jet would be seen.
10217	0	0	
10218	71	21	But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
10219	68	20	spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
10220	70	22	the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
10221	71	21	across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered
10222	68	19	together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible
10223	68	20	sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
10224	0	0	
10225	70	21	In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
10226	71	22	higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
10227	68	18	our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening
10228	68	20	for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,
10229	71	20	and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
10230	69	22	thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
10231	72	19	more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the
10232	71	23	negro yelled out--"There! there again! there she breaches! right ahead!
10233	34	10	The White Whale, the White Whale!"
10234	0	0	
10235	70	20	Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
10236	69	21	bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on
10237	70	21	the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
10238	66	20	his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
10239	61	20	indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
10240	0	0	
10241	69	20	Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
10242	70	21	gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
10243	67	20	ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
10244	69	22	whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
10245	66	19	him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
10246	70	21	perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
10247	20	6	orders for lowering.
10248	0	0	
10249	65	21	The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all
10250	70	17	swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with
10251	66	24	oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same
10252	67	19	spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for
10253	71	19	the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
10254	67	22	phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind.
10255	64	15	A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
10256	72	24	cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating
10257	70	20	from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as
10258	71	19	if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No perceptible
10259	70	25	face or front did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation or
10260	69	19	instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless,
10261	31	12	chance-like apparition of life.
10262	0	0	
10263	71	21	As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
10264	66	21	gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
10265	70	20	exclaimed--"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to
10266	34	11	have seen thee, thou white ghost!"

10276	72	23	Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
10277	67	19	the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being
10278	65	20	so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
10279	71	21	portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
10280	70	22	declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
10281	72	24	of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
10282	68	19	form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale
10283	71	23	his only food. For though other species of whales find their food above
10284	67	20	water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti
10285	68	22	whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and
10286	70	19	only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that
10287	68	19	food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what
10288	68	21	are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus
10289	69	18	exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that
10290	69	18	the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to
10291	72	22	the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is
10292	51	16	supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.

10294	66	22	There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
10295	67	22	Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
10296	70	19	which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
10297	67	20	some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond.
10298	70	21	But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
10299	11	3	assigns it.

10301	67	22	By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious

10304	34	10	but only as the Anak of the tribe.

10311	71	20	With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
10312	71	22	for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
10313	67	24	I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
10314	0	0	
10315	70	19	The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
10316	70	22	vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
10317	72	23	ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to
10318	71	23	the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
10319	69	21	sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity
10320	70	21	too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must
10321	71	23	be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general
10322	70	19	by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it
10323	34	9	may give it compactness and gloss.
10324	0	0	
10325	65	22	Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
10326	71	23	entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
10327	70	20	so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and
10328	69	20	I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more
10329	67	18	handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
10330	70	24	fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian
10331	10	3	to behold.
10332	0	0	
10333	67	17	The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first
10334	70	19	sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment
10335	69	20	its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
10336	69	21	twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
10337	72	21	to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something
10338	70	19	over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally
10339	72	22	coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so
10340	72	22	as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or
10341	72	22	layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart,"
10342	70	24	or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least
10343	68	21	tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
10344	70	22	somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used
10345	71	23	in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an
10346	70	20	entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then
10347	70	19	reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act
10348	60	17	of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
10349	0	0	
10350	68	23	In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
10351	72	24	being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this;
10352	69	22	because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the
10353	69	21	boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly
10354	71	24	three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky
10355	72	19	freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for
10356	69	22	the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up
10357	70	22	a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated
10358	71	23	one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub,
10359	64	22	the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great
10360	38	11	wedding-cake to present to the whales.
10361	0	0	
10362	66	21	Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
10363	68	22	eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
10364	69	20	tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
10365	70	20	This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:
10366	71	26	In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
10367	68	22	neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as
10368	67	22	to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
10369	70	23	harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug
10370	62	20	of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the
10371	68	18	first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
10372	67	21	arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the
10373	67	21	lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
10374	69	21	whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
10375	68	23	minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
10376	70	21	boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
10377	66	21	the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.
10378	0	0	
10379	68	22	Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
10380	72	22	taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again
10381	69	21	carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon
10382	72	21	the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist
10383	71	21	in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at
10384	69	23	the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme
10385	68	23	pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a
10386	69	17	common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs
10387	69	21	in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat
10388	68	21	again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled
10389	69	21	upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a
10390	68	18	little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp--the rope
10391	69	22	which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that
10392	72	23	connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious
10393	10	4	to detail.
10394	0	0	
10395	66	20	Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
10396	66	20	twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the
10397	70	24	oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid
10398	69	21	eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest
10399	67	19	snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
10400	70	22	woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
10401	66	19	and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
10402	65	19	unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
10403	68	19	contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
10404	71	21	circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
10405	68	19	to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit--strange thing! what
10406	72	20	cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,
10407	68	23	and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
10408	69	20	will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus
10409	69	21	hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before
10410	72	19	King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death,
10411	48	15	with a halter around every neck, as you may say.
10412	0	0	
10413	64	20	Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
10414	64	21	those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually
10415	70	20	chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the
10416	71	21	line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in
10417	69	21	the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings
10418	70	19	of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
10419	72	23	wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the
10420	69	23	heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and
10421	69	21	you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning;
10422	69	22	and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of
10423	68	25	volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run
10424	70	24	away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.
10425	0	0	
10426	62	18	Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
10427	69	19	prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
10428	71	20	for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
10429	70	20	contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
10430	70	21	powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the
10431	71	24	line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
10432	72	22	into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
10433	68	20	any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
10434	68	22	live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their
10435	69	17	necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
10436	69	21	that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
10437	71	25	And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would
10438	68	23	not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
10439	64	21	your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.

10446	70	21	If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to

10449	72	23	"When you see him 'quid," said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow
10450	58	18	of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him 'parm whale."

10452	71	18	The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
10453	72	20	to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
10454	71	22	induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through
10455	70	20	which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;
10456	71	18	that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,
10457	72	23	and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the
10458	49	16	Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
10459	0	0	
10460	67	17	It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
10461	72	22	leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in
10462	71	23	what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that
10463	68	20	dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my
10464	69	18	body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long
10465	50	13	after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
10466	0	0	
10467	72	25	Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen
10468	70	20	at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last
10469	68	17	all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing
10470	69	19	that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman.
10471	72	21	The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance
10472	54	16	of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
10473	0	0	
10474	70	20	Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
10475	72	22	hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;
10476	72	22	with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty
10477	69	20	fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the
10478	72	23	capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,
10479	68	20	glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in
10480	72	23	the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury
10481	70	21	jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
10482	72	19	afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some
10483	69	20	enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
10484	72	22	started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts
10485	70	22	of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
10486	72	19	forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
10487	33	10	the sparkling brine into the air.
10488	0	0	
10489	71	21	"Clear away the boats! Luff!" cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
10490	65	18	dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
10491	0	0	
10492	72	23	The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
10493	71	21	the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
10494	68	19	but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he
10495	71	20	swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave
10496	67	20	orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in
10497	70	24	whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats,
10498	68	17	we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the
10499	69	20	noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the
10500	69	21	monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and
10501	49	15	then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
10502	0	0	
10503	71	21	"There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
10504	72	20	Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was
10505	71	21	granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
10506	67	21	rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat, and much
10507	69	22	nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honour
10508	72	22	of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become
10509	67	25	aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no
10510	72	22	longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And
10511	68	19	still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.
10512	0	0	
10513	71	21	Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,
10514	68	20	he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
10515	23	6	yeast which he brewed.*

10518	67	20	*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
10519	71	23	the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists. Though
10520	69	20	apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
10521	69	24	him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does
10522	70	20	so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the
10523	68	19	upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water
10524	69	22	formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he
10525	68	18	thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
10526	48	16	galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.

10529	69	15	"Start her, start her, my men! Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty of
10530	69	16	time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all," cried
10531	71	19	Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. "Start her, now; give 'em
10532	68	14	the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy--start
10533	64	19	her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the word--easy,
10534	71	20	easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
10535	70	21	buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys--that's all. Start
10536	5	1	her!"
10537	0	0	
10538	65	22	"Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some
10539	65	21	old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
10540	68	23	involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
10541	28	10	which the eager Indian gave.
10542	0	0	
10543	69	21	But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. "Kee-hee!
10544	70	21	Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
10545	32	11	like a pacing tiger in his cage.
10546	0	0	
10547	65	22	"Ka-la! Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
10548	69	20	mouthful of Grenadier's steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels
10549	67	20	cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still
10550	69	21	encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from
10551	67	20	his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the
10552	65	17	welcome cry was heard--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give it to him!" The
10553	67	19	harpoon was hurled. "Stern all!" The oarsmen backed water; the same
10554	70	20	moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists.
10555	72	20	It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two
10556	71	22	additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
10557	72	22	increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled
10558	65	19	with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and
10559	66	21	round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
10560	67	15	blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb's hands, from
10561	69	20	which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
10562	69	20	these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy's
10563	72	18	sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving
10564	31	9	to wrest it out of your clutch.
10565	0	0	
10566	72	21	"Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
10567	71	19	by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More
10568	72	21	turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now
10569	72	20	flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego
10570	72	19	here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering business truly in that
10571	18	6	rocking commotion.

10574	65	18	*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
10575	66	17	stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
10576	65	19	running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
10577	69	21	bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most
10578	11	4	convenient.

10581	72	21	From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
10582	72	20	the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would
10583	71	21	have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water, the other
10584	71	22	the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once.
10585	68	22	A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in
10586	72	21	her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little
10587	71	20	finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale
10588	69	19	into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main clinging
10589	70	20	to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of
10590	71	23	Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring
10591	70	21	down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed
10592	70	19	as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened
10593	11	2	his flight.
10594	0	0	
10595	65	18	"Haul in--haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
10596	72	20	towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
10597	72	18	the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly
10598	70	19	planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
10599	66	17	flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning
10600	70	20	out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow, and then ranging up for
10601	14	4	another fling.
10602	0	0	
10603	72	22	The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
10604	72	19	hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled
10605	71	20	and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing
10606	70	21	upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every
10607	65	19	face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all
10608	69	20	the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the
10609	69	20	spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of
10610	67	22	the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked
10611	67	20	lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and
10612	69	23	again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again
10613	23	7	sent it into the whale.
10614	0	0	
10615	68	18	"Pull up--pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
10616	69	19	relaxed in his wrath. "Pull up!--close to!" and the boat ranged along
10617	70	16	the fish's flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned
10618	64	17	his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
10619	71	23	churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
10620	70	19	watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
10621	72	22	breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the
10622	68	17	innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from
10623	71	19	his trance into that unspeakable thing called his "flurry," the monster
10624	68	21	horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable,
10625	68	17	mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping
10626	64	17	astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied
10627	39	12	twilight into the clear air of the day.
10628	0	0	
10629	72	23	And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;
10630	69	20	surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his
10631	70	20	spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush
10632	72	22	after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
10633	70	20	wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping
10634	61	17	down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
10635	0	0	
10636	36	9	"He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.
10637	0	0	
10638	69	18	"Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
10639	71	21	Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
10640	48	14	thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.

10645	0	0	
10646	0	0	
10647	50	14	A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
10648	0	0	
10649	71	24	According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
10650	65	18	off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
10651	68	22	steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
10652	72	24	oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous
10653	72	20	arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called
10654	67	19	a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of
10655	70	20	twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase,
10656	70	24	the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost;
10657	70	24	indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the
10658	70	20	rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid
10659	65	21	exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's
10660	72	20	compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started--what
10661	69	21	that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl
10662	72	20	very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this
10663	70	18	straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once
10664	71	22	the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and give it
10665	65	19	to him!" He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his
10666	72	19	centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little
10667	69	20	strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No
10668	71	21	wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty
10669	72	21	fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many
10670	70	22	hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some
10671	70	20	of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that
10672	70	22	some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder
10673	72	19	that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the
10674	71	25	harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his
10675	58	16	body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!
10676	0	0	
10677	70	20	Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
10678	68	21	that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
10679	67	21	likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
10680	65	19	themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and
10681	69	20	the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
10682	32	10	station in the bows of the boat.
10683	0	0	
10684	72	21	Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish
10685	67	18	and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to
10686	66	18	last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing
10687	70	23	whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious
10688	72	21	to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss
10689	70	25	of speed in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more
10690	70	23	than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures
10691	69	19	in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the
10692	67	24	whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has
10693	12	4	caused them.
10694	0	0	
10695	70	23	To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
10696	72	21	world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of
10697	5	2	toil.

10704	67	17	Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
10705	39	10	productive subjects, grow the chapters.

10707	70	24	The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
10708	72	21	It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which
10709	68	22	is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow,
10710	68	21	for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the
10711	72	19	harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow.
10712	70	19	Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it
10713	67	19	up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from
10714	70	20	the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,
10715	47	13	respectively called the first and second irons.
10716	0	0	
10717	69	19	But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
10718	68	19	the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
10719	72	21	instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming
10720	69	21	drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a
10721	68	19	doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the
10722	70	25	instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving
10723	65	22	the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however
10724	67	19	lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.
10725	68	21	Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,
10726	66	19	and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be
10727	70	24	anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the
10728	71	21	most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water,
10729	71	22	it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned
10730	70	19	in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently
10731	68	20	practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the
10732	34	11	saddest and most fatal casualties.
10733	0	0	
10734	62	17	Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
10735	65	19	overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
10736	70	20	skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
10737	69	23	or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
10738	69	24	Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
10739	29	9	fairly captured and a corpse.
10740	0	0	
10741	68	21	Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
10742	68	21	one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
10743	68	22	qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
10744	68	25	such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
10745	72	25	simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied
10746	65	20	with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one
10747	67	23	be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
10748	68	23	faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
10749	69	23	most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
10750	8	3	painted.

10757	65	18	Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was
10758	66	19	a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
10759	72	22	business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men
10760	72	18	with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers,
10761	69	21	slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the
10762	68	20	sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals;
10763	69	23	good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we
10764	66	19	moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call
10765	70	21	it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky
10766	70	21	freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we
10767	62	19	towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk.
10768	0	0	
10769	62	17	Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's
10770	66	21	main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
10771	72	22	dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing
10772	71	24	the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing
10773	72	19	it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way
10774	61	19	into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.
10775	0	0	
10776	65	22	Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
10777	72	22	evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature
10778	71	27	was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed
10779	67	18	working in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that
10780	70	21	Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were
10781	66	18	brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand,
10782	69	23	monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on
10783	67	18	the Pequod's decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in
10784	71	20	the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust
10785	69	17	rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast
10786	69	20	corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the
10787	69	17	stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black
10788	70	18	hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night,
10789	68	17	which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale,
10790	72	25	seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while
10791	28	8	the other remains standing.*
10792	0	0	
10793	0	0	
10794	66	19	*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
10795	70	22	reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
10796	67	18	is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part
10797	67	21	is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
10798	72	24	flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so
10799	66	19	that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
10800	70	23	put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
10801	72	22	small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and
10802	70	20	a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By
10803	68	25	adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
10804	71	20	of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
10805	72	21	made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked
10806	71	20	fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with
10807	26	8	its broad flukes or lobes.

10810	71	23	If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
10811	67	18	on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an
10812	70	23	unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
10813	70	23	he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
10814	70	22	to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping
10815	72	22	cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest.
10816	71	21	Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale
10817	35	11	as a flavorish thing to his palate.

10819	70	25	"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut

10822	71	21	Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
10823	71	21	thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
10824	71	23	the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds
10825	68	21	of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers
10826	69	22	who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale
10827	67	18	designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
10828	0	0	
10829	64	18	About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
10830	70	20	lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
10831	71	21	at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb
10832	72	18	the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings
10833	69	19	with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming
10834	68	20	round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few
10835	71	19	sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping
10836	69	21	of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers'
10837	68	24	hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you
10838	70	19	heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on
10839	72	24	their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the
10840	68	21	bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all
10841	68	23	but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they
10842	71	23	contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the
10843	71	20	universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale,
10844	71	22	may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking
10845	12	3	for a screw.
10846	0	0	
10847	71	21	Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
10848	70	17	will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like hungry dogs
10849	64	20	round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down
10850	70	20	every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant
10851	69	20	butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's
10852	67	18	live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,
10853	68	22	also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away
10854	72	23	under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole
10855	70	19	affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that
10856	67	20	is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and
10857	66	22	though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
10858	72	20	crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in
10859	71	24	case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently
10860	69	21	buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down,
10861	66	17	touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most
10862	64	21	socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no
10863	70	23	conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
10864	70	22	numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm
10865	63	21	whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never
10866	66	21	seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
10867	60	19	devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.

10869	67	18	But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
10870	72	20	going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his
10871	19	7	own epicurean lips.

10873	68	19	"Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?" he cried at length, widening
10874	72	21	his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
10875	68	19	and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
10876	55	16	with his lance; "cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!"

10878	66	19	The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
10879	72	23	roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling
10880	69	18	along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something
10881	70	20	the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like
10882	71	19	his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and
10883	71	17	limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy
10884	72	24	fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered
10885	70	23	along, and in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on
10886	68	19	the opposite side of Stubb's sideboard; when, with both hands folded
10887	72	21	before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back
10888	71	22	still further over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as
10889	32	9	to bring his best ear into play.
10890	0	0	
10891	66	18	"Cook," said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
10892	66	21	mouth, "don't you think this steak is rather overdone? You've been
10893	70	21	beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender. Don't I always say
10894	68	21	that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks
10895	70	22	now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a
10896	71	19	shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to 'em; tell 'em they are
10897	68	20	welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must
10898	65	21	keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and
10899	68	19	deliver my message. Here, take this lantern," snatching one from his
10900	44	12	sideboard; "now then, go and preach to 'em!"
10901	0	0	
10902	70	20	Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck
10903	72	18	to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the
10904	70	23	sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand
10905	68	21	he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a
10906	72	18	mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling
10907	36	11	behind, overheard all that was said.

10986	68	21	"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,

10988	70	23	mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
10989	38	13	question. "Where were you born, cook?"

11005	72	20	"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit of

11009	70	20	Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro

11015	58	17	"Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.

11020	72	21	tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb. "Where

11028	72	18	"When dis old brack man dies," said the negro slowly, changing his whole

11035	69	20	"Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
11036	31	9	keeping it there very solemnly.
11037	0	0	
11038	72	24	"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you

11040	14	4	Main-top, eh?"
11041	0	0	
11042	56	15	"Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.
11043	0	0	
11044	68	22	"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where
11045	70	22	your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
11046	70	19	crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don't
11047	70	20	get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It's a
11048	68	20	ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go. But none of
11049	70	21	us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye
11050	70	21	hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other a'top of your heart,
11051	70	17	when I'm giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?--that's
11052	70	20	your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!--that's it--now you have it. Hold it there
11053	24	7	now, and pay attention."
11054	0	0	
11055	70	18	"All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
11056	70	19	vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at
11057	22	8	one and the same time.
11058	0	0	
11059	68	20	"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
11060	72	23	that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don't
11061	67	21	you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my
11062	70	21	private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so as not to
11063	71	22	spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal
11064	71	19	to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear? And now to-morrow,
11065	66	19	cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get
11066	69	18	the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the
11067	54	16	flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go."

11084	71	21	That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
11085	67	18	like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
11086	71	22	outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
11087	17	5	philosophy of it.
11088	0	0	
11089	67	22	It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
11090	66	22	Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
11091	70	22	prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of the
11092	71	26	court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
11093	69	25	eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
11094	69	24	whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The
11095	72	23	meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well
11096	66	19	seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.
11097	69	19	The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great
11098	30	8	porpoise grant from the crown.
11099	0	0	
11100	68	18	The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
11101	68	20	hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
11102	67	24	when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
11103	68	22	long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men
11104	72	25	like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not
11105	67	22	so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
11106	71	24	old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous
11107	71	19	doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
11108	70	20	juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who
11109	70	20	long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel--that
11110	67	19	these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
11111	69	20	whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among
11112	69	18	the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called "fritters"; which, indeed,
11113	68	17	they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
11114	72	21	like old Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They
11115	72	20	have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly
11116	19	5	keep his hands off.
11117	0	0	
11118	66	21	But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
11119	70	23	exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
11120	67	22	delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as
11121	71	22	the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
11122	68	18	pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
11123	71	23	is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
11124	70	18	third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
11125	70	22	butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
11126	63	17	some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try
11127	69	20	watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
11128	71	21	ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many
11129	31	11	a good supper have I thus made.
11130	0	0	
11131	72	23	In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.
11132	70	19	The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,
11133	72	19	whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),
11134	71	22	they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess,
11135	71	22	in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish among
11136	66	21	some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the
11137	69	19	epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to
11138	61	20	have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a
11139	66	20	calf's head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon
11140	63	19	discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with an
11141	65	22	intelligent looking calf's head before him, is somehow one of the
11142	69	21	saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at
11143	39	11	him, with an "Et tu Brute!" expression.
11144	0	0	
11145	64	21	It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
11146	72	23	unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence;
11147	66	22	that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before
11148	72	23	mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea,
11149	69	19	and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever
11150	70	21	murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if
11151	71	22	he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and
11152	68	22	he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market
11153	71	21	of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the
11154	69	22	long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of
11155	72	21	the cannibal's jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will
11156	69	24	be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in
11157	70	23	his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that
11158	72	22	provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized
11159	70	23	and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and feastest
11160	49	16	on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.
11161	0	0	
11162	67	17	But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
11163	68	20	adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my
11164	70	22	civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is
11165	70	19	that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
11166	69	24	you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
11167	72	21	that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did
11168	70	21	the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders
11169	70	19	formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two
11170	68	23	that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel
11171	5	1	pens.

11178	68	19	When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
11179	71	23	weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
11180	71	22	thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
11181	70	23	him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very
11182	70	23	soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the
11183	71	22	common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a'lee; and then send
11184	72	21	every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that,
11185	71	18	until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for
11186	70	23	an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see
11187	19	5	that all goes well.
11188	0	0	
11189	70	22	But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will
11190	67	20	not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
11191	71	22	round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
11192	67	18	stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning.
11193	69	21	In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
11194	68	22	largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
11195	69	18	diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades,
11196	68	20	a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
11197	67	19	tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the
11198	66	18	present case with the Pequod's sharks; though, to be sure, any man
11199	69	21	unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
11200	70	24	would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
11201	31	8	those sharks the maggots in it.
11202	0	0	
11203	70	19	Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
11204	66	22	concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman
11205	67	19	came on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for
11206	69	22	immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering
11207	70	18	three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
11208	70	20	sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an
11209	67	18	incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep
11210	68	19	into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy
11211	69	19	confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
11212	68	21	always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
11213	72	23	incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each
11214	68	19	other's disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit
11215	70	23	their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by
11216	68	21	the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was
11217	70	19	this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
11218	70	24	creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
11219	70	21	their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
11220	71	21	life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
11221	71	23	one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried
11222	47	14	to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.

11225	70	20	*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
11226	66	20	is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general shape,
11227	69	19	corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
11228	70	20	sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
11229	68	19	the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when
11230	69	23	being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a
11231	70	18	stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.

11243	67	21	It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
11244	69	22	professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
11245	68	23	turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would
11246	71	23	have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
11247	0	0	
11248	71	22	In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
11249	72	19	things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which
11250	72	18	no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up
11251	71	19	to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest
11252	67	21	point anywhere above a ship's deck. The end of the hawser-like rope
11253	70	20	winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass,
11254	68	19	and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to
11255	72	21	this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was
11256	72	20	attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,
11257	68	20	the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the
11258	68	22	body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two
11259	71	23	side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole,
11260	70	20	the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild
11261	69	20	chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When
11262	66	20	instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in
11263	69	21	her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she
11264	68	17	trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More
11265	70	23	and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the
11266	71	19	windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last,
11267	67	16	a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls
11268	69	18	upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises
11269	67	21	into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the
11270	72	20	first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely
11271	63	18	as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body
11272	71	22	precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the
11273	69	18	strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale
11274	67	20	rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip
11275	69	21	uniformly peels off along the line called the "scarf," simultaneously
11276	71	17	cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as
11277	72	20	it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the
11278	72	22	time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the
11279	70	21	main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment
11280	68	20	or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let
11281	69	20	down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge
11282	66	18	it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong
11283	10	4	overboard.
11284	0	0	
11285	70	24	One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
11286	70	20	called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
11287	72	23	out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this
11288	67	21	hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked
11289	69	22	so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what
11290	69	18	follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to
11291	72	21	stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few
11292	69	20	sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain;
11293	71	17	so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip,
11294	68	20	called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.
11295	70	22	The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
11296	71	20	peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly
11297	71	19	slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway
11298	71	22	right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into
11299	70	19	this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
11300	66	22	blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents.
11301	65	18	And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering
11302	69	21	simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing,
11303	64	18	the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship
11304	71	21	straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the
11305	17	6	general friction.

11312	72	22	I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of
11313	70	25	the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen
11314	67	25	afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains
11315	37	12	unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
11316	0	0	
11317	69	22	The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you
11318	70	19	know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence
11319	71	22	of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
11320	67	19	ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
11321	0	0	
11322	72	23	Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's
11323	69	19	skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point
11324	70	25	of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you
11325	71	22	cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body but
11326	71	23	that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if
11327	72	20	reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred
11328	71	22	dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely
11329	68	17	thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds
11330	71	20	of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,
11331	69	19	previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but
11332	70	20	becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which
11333	71	22	I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before;
11334	69	23	and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself
11335	67	21	with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is
11336	70	23	pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may
11337	70	20	say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin,
11338	67	19	isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the
11339	68	21	whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as
11340	72	21	the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say,
11341	71	21	that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender
11342	55	14	than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.
11343	0	0	
11344	71	18	Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
11345	70	21	as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
11346	72	21	hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or
11347	71	20	rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,
11348	68	23	and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had
11349	68	23	of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere
11350	70	22	integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels
11351	71	21	to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters
11352	33	8	of the stuff of the whale's skin.
11353	0	0	
11354	70	22	In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
11355	72	22	the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
11356	69	17	crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
11357	69	23	something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these
11358	68	22	marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
11359	67	22	mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved
11360	71	20	upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,
11361	67	22	observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but
11362	71	24	afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical;
11363	70	19	that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
11364	65	18	hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
11365	69	21	connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm
11366	72	21	Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old
11367	67	23	Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on
11368	69	19	the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the
11369	71	24	mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian
11370	72	21	rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which
11371	68	19	the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the
11372	66	19	back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the
11373	64	23	regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,
11374	70	22	altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New
11375	72	22	England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks
11376	70	20	of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I should say,
11377	67	18	that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this
11378	68	21	particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are
11379	67	19	probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most
11380	60	16	remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.
11381	0	0	
11382	67	19	A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
11383	71	20	the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
11384	68	21	pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very
11385	70	20	happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
11386	71	23	as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho
11387	72	20	slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this
11388	70	20	cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself
11389	70	21	comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would
11390	70	22	become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the
11391	64	19	North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are
11392	69	21	found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it
11393	66	20	observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies
11394	67	22	are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of
11395	67	22	an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire;
11396	72	21	whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood,
11397	69	21	and he dies. How wonderful is it then--except after explanation--that
11398	70	21	this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it
11399	66	20	is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed
11400	68	20	to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall
11401	71	22	overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly
11402	64	20	frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued
11403	66	19	in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by
11404	68	21	experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a
11405	23	8	Borneo negro in summer.
11406	0	0	
11407	66	23	It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
11408	69	22	individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
11409	72	24	virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after
11410	69	24	the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in
11411	70	22	this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood
11412	67	20	fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and like the
11413	70	24	great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.

11415	71	22	But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,

11417	6	2	whale!

11426	71	21	The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
11427	70	23	beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
11428	67	17	it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.
11429	64	19	Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and
11430	72	24	splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious
11431	66	19	flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting
11432	69	20	poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats further
11433	69	18	and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem
11434	70	22	square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous
11435	69	21	din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous
11436	70	22	sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair
11437	71	22	face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass
11438	62	19	of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.
11439	0	0	
11440	72	22	There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in
11441	70	21	pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled.
11442	63	20	In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if
11443	71	24	peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they
11444	72	22	most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not
11445	28	9	the mightiest whale is free.
11446	0	0	
11447	64	18	Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
11448	72	23	survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or
11449	70	20	blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the
11450	67	17	swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
11451	69	19	the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the
11452	67	17	whale's unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
11453	66	20	log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS: BEWARE! And for years
11454	67	18	afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly
11455	70	28	sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there
11456	67	18	when a stick was held. There's your law of precedents; there's your
11457	70	23	utility of traditions; there's the story of your obstinate survival of
11458	69	22	old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in
11459	27	8	the air! There's orthodoxy!
11460	0	0	
11461	70	22	Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror
11462	66	21	to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
11463	6	1	world.

11474	69	22	It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
11475	69	22	the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the
11476	67	24	Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
11477	66	20	whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
11478	0	0	
11479	71	19	Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
11480	69	20	on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
11481	65	17	very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the
11482	67	24	surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
11483	64	18	between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
11484	70	24	discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear
11485	72	21	in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many
11486	68	22	feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without so
11487	67	20	much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
11488	71	20	made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,
11489	70	22	and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
11490	66	17	into the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he
11491	49	16	demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?
11492	0	0	
11493	72	20	When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
11494	67	18	till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale
11495	70	22	it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full
11496	71	21	grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's head embraces
11497	69	20	nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a
11498	69	20	burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as
11499	70	20	vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers' scales.

11501	72	22	The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
11502	71	23	hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea, so that
11503	72	22	it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there
11504	68	20	with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the
11505	67	19	enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
11506	64	20	on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
11507	61	19	blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the giant
11508	39	11	Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.

11510	69	19	When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
11511	69	25	below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
11512	66	21	now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
11513	72	26	lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon
11514	8	3	the sea.

11516	69	24	A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
11517	68	20	from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
11518	63	19	gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he
11519	64	18	took Stubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's
11520	71	22	Decapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
11521	66	19	mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood
11522	54	18	leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
11523	0	0	
11524	68	20	It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
11525	71	19	intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert. "Speak, thou vast
11526	69	21	and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though ungarnished with a
11527	72	21	beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head,
11528	70	19	and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast
11529	69	20	dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has
11530	70	23	moved amid this world's foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies
11531	72	20	rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this
11532	72	22	frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there,
11533	69	20	in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast
11534	72	20	been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side,
11535	69	21	where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou
11536	68	18	saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart
11537	70	22	to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when
11538	70	22	heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed
11539	68	19	by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper
11540	64	20	midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on
11541	67	18	unharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
11542	69	22	would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O
11543	71	23	head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of
11544	40	12	Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"
11545	0	0	
11546	60	19	"Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
11547	0	0	
11548	64	17	"Aye? Well, now, that's cheering," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
11549	62	17	himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.
11550	68	17	"That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
11551	18	5	man.--Where away?"

11558	72	24	how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest

11566	70	20	Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than
11567	44	13	the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
11568	0	0	
11569	71	16	By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned mast-heads
11570	72	20	proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting
11571	70	22	by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could
11572	71	22	not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would
11573	8	3	be made.
11574	0	0	
11575	72	22	Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of
11576	70	23	the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals
11577	66	21	being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
11578	63	19	attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale
11579	70	26	commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
11580	50	15	considerable distances and with no small facility.
11581	0	0	
11582	70	18	The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's setting
11583	72	21	her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring
11584	66	20	her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod's lee, and
11585	68	21	lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being
11586	67	20	rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain, the
11587	66	19	stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token
11588	65	21	of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that
11589	68	22	the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her
11590	67	20	captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's company. For, though
11591	72	21	himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half
11592	70	22	a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing
11593	68	24	between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the
11594	66	20	land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the
11595	7	3	Pequod.
11596	0	0	
11597	66	19	But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
11598	70	21	interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam's
11599	72	25	boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
11600	71	21	Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew
11601	69	19	very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by
11602	71	23	the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some
11603	69	21	way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings
11604	72	22	again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a
11605	72	24	conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not
11606	60	19	without still another interruption of a very different sort.
11607	0	0	
11608	62	21	Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular
11609	72	27	appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities
11610	70	20	make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled
11611	69	21	all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A
11612	71	23	long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped
11613	69	20	him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A
11614	48	16	deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
11615	0	0	
11616	57	17	So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
11617	65	17	exclaimed--"That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the
11618	68	18	Town-Ho's company told us of!" Stubb here alluded to a strange story
11619	65	21	told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
11620	69	22	previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account
11621	67	21	and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
11622	71	24	question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
11623	29	8	Jeroboam. His story was this:
11624	0	0	
11625	68	23	He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
11626	68	20	Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
11627	67	21	meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
11628	70	21	trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
11629	72	21	carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,
11630	67	21	was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim
11631	67	20	having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with
11632	69	22	that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense
11633	63	21	exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the
11634	65	20	Jeroboam's whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon
11635	68	20	the ship's getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a
11636	69	21	freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
11637	66	21	the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby
11638	65	20	he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
11639	72	23	vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which he
11640	71	19	declared these things;--the dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited
11641	71	26	imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united
11642	67	20	to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant
11643	69	22	crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid of
11644	71	20	him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,
11645	72	24	especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous
11646	63	20	captain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that
11647	72	22	individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the
11648	69	20	archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship
11649	68	23	and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was
11650	71	20	carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew,
11651	71	20	that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel
11652	72	21	was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore
11653	70	21	forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any
11654	69	20	way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that
11655	68	22	Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all
11656	72	20	this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
11657	70	23	mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand
11658	70	21	than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole
11659	68	21	command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.
11660	72	21	The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before
11661	71	24	him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal
11662	66	20	homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however
11663	72	21	wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking
11664	71	23	in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as
11665	70	23	his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But
11666	35	12	it is time to return to the Pequod.
11667	0	0	
11668	71	21	"I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
11669	55	15	Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; "come on board."
11670	0	0	
11671	36	11	But now Gabriel started to his feet.
11672	0	0	
11673	71	21	"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
11674	8	3	plague!"
11675	0	0	
11676	66	20	"Gabriel! Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either--" But
11677	71	22	that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
11678	19	5	drowned all speech.
11679	0	0	
11680	70	21	"Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
11681	5	1	back.
11682	0	0	
11683	72	19	"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible
11684	6	2	tail!"
11685	0	0	
11686	72	25	"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--" But again the boat tore ahead as if
11687	72	21	dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession
11688	69	23	of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices
11689	70	22	of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm
11690	69	23	whale's head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing
11691	72	24	it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to
11692	8	2	warrant.
11693	0	0	
11694	63	19	When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
11695	71	21	concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from
11696	71	23	Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed
11697	17	6	leagued with him.
11698	0	0	
11699	70	22	It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
11700	72	24	a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby
11701	71	21	Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,
11702	63	20	Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White
11703	69	21	Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity,
11704	69	21	pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God
11705	71	22	incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two
11706	72	18	afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the
11707	72	23	chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself
11708	64	20	being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all
11709	66	22	the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in
11710	72	21	persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after
11711	70	20	much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last
11712	67	23	succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to
11713	70	21	the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and
11714	70	24	hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants
11715	67	19	of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his
11716	69	18	boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting
11717	71	23	his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance
11718	72	22	for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
11719	70	23	quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies
11720	67	20	of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious
11721	67	20	life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his
11722	70	21	descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a
11723	70	21	chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the
11724	19	6	mate for ever sank.
11725	0	0	
11726	67	21	It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
11727	68	18	Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
11728	66	21	Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
11729	71	19	oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
11730	69	19	headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But
11731	70	20	strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
11732	66	21	when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
11733	38	11	discernible; the man being stark dead.
11734	0	0	
11735	72	20	The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried
11736	71	21	from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the vial!" Gabriel
11737	67	17	called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the
11738	70	21	whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;
11739	65	23	because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
11740	71	22	fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any
11741	72	22	one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
11742	61	20	wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.
11743	0	0	
11744	65	21	Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to
11745	69	21	him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
11746	71	21	intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which
11747	66	20	Ahab answered--"Aye." Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started
11748	69	20	to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
11749	72	18	downward pointed finger--"Think, think of the blasphemer--dead, and down
11750	40	11	there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"
11751	0	0	
11752	65	21	Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have
11753	68	19	just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
11754	57	17	officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag."
11755	0	0	
11756	72	23	Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
11757	68	19	whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends
11758	67	22	upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus,
11759	69	21	most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after
11760	47	17	attaining an age of two or three years or more.
11761	0	0	
11762	72	20	Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,
11763	67	20	damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence
11764	68	20	of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death
11765	42	11	himself might well have been the post-boy.
11766	0	0	
11767	70	20	"Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab. "Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it's but
11768	71	18	a dim scrawl;--what's this?" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
11769	70	17	long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
11770	70	20	insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
11771	34	9	its coming any closer to the ship.
11772	0	0	
11773	63	16	Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har--yes, Mr.
11774	68	15	Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.
11775	60	15	Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!"
11776	0	0	
11777	70	19	"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but let
11778	12	4	me have it."
11779	0	0	
11780	72	21	"Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon going that
11781	5	1	way."
11782	0	0	
11783	69	18	"Curses throttle thee!" yelled Ahab. "Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
11784	67	19	receive it"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands, he
11785	72	22	caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat.
11786	72	21	But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat
11787	71	17	drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that, as if by magic, the
11788	70	20	letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager hand. He clutched it
11789	68	21	in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it,
11790	68	19	sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then
11791	72	24	Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in
11792	64	20	that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.

11794	71	23	As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
11795	71	20	of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
11796	7	3	affair.

11803	72	24	In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there
11804	68	17	is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are
11805	71	22	wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying
11806	72	24	in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done
11807	70	22	everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description
11808	68	22	of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned
11809	69	19	that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook
11810	66	21	was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
11811	65	18	mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook
11812	69	20	get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend
11813	63	22	Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the
11814	68	19	monster's back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many
11815	68	23	cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the
11816	69	21	whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The
11817	68	21	whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the
11818	69	24	immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the
11819	67	22	level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the
11820	72	21	whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill
11821	65	25	beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the
11822	67	17	Highland costume--a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least,
11823	68	24	he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to
11824	39	11	observe him, as will presently be seen.
11825	0	0	
11826	70	20	Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar
11827	69	19	in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to
11828	70	20	attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead
11829	71	23	whale's back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
11830	69	20	a long cord. Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg
11831	67	18	down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery
11832	68	20	a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
11833	6	2	waist.
11834	0	0	
11835	68	23	It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
11836	65	19	proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
11837	70	19	both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
11838	72	22	leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were
11839	70	24	wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage
11840	69	20	and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag
11841	71	25	me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us.
11842	69	22	Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get
11843	64	22	rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
11844	0	0	
11845	72	21	So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that
11846	69	22	while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive
11847	68	20	that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of
11848	70	20	two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another's
11849	70	24	mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster
11850	66	21	and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in
11851	67	22	Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an
11852	66	19	injustice. And yet still further pondering--while I jerked him now
11853	69	19	and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam
11854	70	21	him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine
11855	70	22	was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most
11856	72	24	cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality
11857	72	22	of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by
11858	66	23	mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say
11859	65	21	that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the
11860	63	23	multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg's
11861	72	24	monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came
11862	72	21	very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I
11863	51	16	would, I only had the management of one end of it.*

11866	71	21	*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
11867	72	22	that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement
11868	67	21	upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb,
11869	67	22	in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible
11870	71	24	guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.

11873	68	24	I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
11874	72	21	whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
11875	71	18	rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy
11876	71	22	he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
11877	72	18	night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
11878	71	20	blood which began to flow from the carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed
11879	32	13	round it like bees in a beehive.
11880	0	0	
11881	67	20	And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
11882	67	23	aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were
11883	65	19	it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
11884	58	19	miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
11885	0	0	
11886	65	20	Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
11887	72	24	ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.
11888	70	19	Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked
11889	67	22	the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed
11890	64	21	a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still another
11891	66	22	protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego
11892	64	24	and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
11893	69	19	whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
11894	71	22	reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
11895	70	22	benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best happiness, I admit; but
11896	72	20	in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both
11897	71	19	he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water,
11898	68	24	those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg
11899	70	23	than a tall. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there
11900	71	24	with that great iron hook--poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his
11901	54	16	Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
11902	0	0	
11903	69	18	Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
11904	69	19	and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters
11905	71	25	it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
11906	71	22	in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
11907	70	19	sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
11908	55	18	and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
11909	0	0	
11910	72	26	But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as
11911	70	21	with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs
11912	70	19	up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over
11913	66	20	the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory
11914	70	16	glance hands him--what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands
11915	36	11	him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
11916	0	0	
11917	67	19	"Ginger? Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
11918	70	19	"Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then
11919	68	20	standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
11920	68	19	astonished steward slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you have
11921	72	21	the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger?
11922	71	23	Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire
11923	62	17	in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!--what the devil is ginger?
11924	68	20	Sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the
11925	68	24	devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg
11926	6	2	here."

11928	62	22	"There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
11929	68	18	business," he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
11930	69	19	come from forward. "Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of it,
11931	68	21	if you please." Then watching the mate's countenance, he added, "The
11932	67	18	steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap
11933	65	20	to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an
11934	69	18	apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
11935	54	14	which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?"
11936	0	0	
11937	56	15	"I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."
11938	0	0	
11939	60	17	"Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to drug a
11940	71	27	harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here; you want to poison
11941	70	24	us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
11942	40	11	us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"
11943	0	0	
11944	71	19	"It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought the
11945	72	23	ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but
11946	40	10	only this ginger-jub--so she called it."
11947	0	0	
11948	66	18	"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye
11949	67	18	to the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
11950	66	20	Starbuck. It is the captain's orders--grog for the harpooneer on a
11951	7	2	whale."
11952	0	0	
11953	61	16	"Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but--"
11954	0	0	
11955	71	21	"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
11956	72	21	that sort; and this fellow's a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?"

11960	72	21	When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort
11961	70	19	of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was
11962	68	20	handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and that was
11963	26	8	freely given to the waves.

11971	67	19	It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's
11972	64	21	prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side. But we must let it
11973	72	23	continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it.
11974	71	18	For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the
11975	45	13	head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
11976	0	0	
11977	65	19	Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
11978	68	20	drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
11979	69	23	gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
11980	69	22	Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
11981	69	21	anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
11982	71	25	those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to
11983	70	20	cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
11984	64	19	the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale
11985	68	22	had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
11986	72	22	announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if
11987	20	7	opportunity offered.
11988	0	0	
11989	68	19	Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
11990	69	18	boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further
11991	68	21	and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
11992	69	20	the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
11993	71	24	tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
11994	69	20	both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
11995	70	17	plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
11996	64	18	towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at
11997	70	22	first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
11998	70	19	maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
11999	67	17	view, as if diving under the keel. "Cut, cut!" was the cry from the
12000	71	21	ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
12001	71	19	brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side. But having plenty
12002	70	19	of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
12003	70	24	paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
12004	72	21	might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was
12005	71	21	intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line
12006	71	23	in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending
12007	72	23	strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance
12008	69	18	they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when
12009	67	17	instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the
12010	68	20	keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose
12011	71	20	to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its
12012	70	17	drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water,
12013	71	23	while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were
12014	72	20	free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering
12015	71	20	his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
12016	47	14	him, so that they performed a complete circuit.
12017	0	0	
12018	64	22	Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
12019	63	16	flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for
12020	69	20	lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
12021	71	19	multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's body,
12022	71	18	rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
12023	72	23	new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that
12024	29	8	poured from the smitten rock.

12026	69	17	At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
12027	30	9	turned upon his back a corpse.

12029	71	21	While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
12030	64	19	and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
12031	33	12	conversation ensued between them.

12033	67	17	"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard," said
12034	70	20	Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
12035	20	8	ignoble a leviathan.
12036	0	0	
12037	71	20	"Wants with it?" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's bow,
12038	68	19	"did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale's
12039	72	23	head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale's
12040	68	19	on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never
12041	20	6	afterwards capsize?"
12042	0	0	
12043	9	1	"Why not?
12044	0	0	
12045	70	20	"I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,
12046	67	19	and he seems to know all about ships' charms. But I sometimes think
12047	69	17	he'll charm the ship to no good at last. I don't half like that chap,
12048	72	22	Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into
12049	23	6	a snake's head, Stubb?"
12050	0	0	
12051	70	22	"Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
12052	69	16	dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
12053	67	22	down there, Flask"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of
12054	72	20	both hands--"Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
12055	71	24	disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
12056	68	20	stowed away on board ship? He's the devil, I say. The reason why you
12057	70	23	don't see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries
12058	69	20	it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of
12059	67	20	it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots."

12061	70	18	"He sleeps in his boots, don't he? He hasn't got any hammock; but I've

12080	67	19	"I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
12081	66	19	one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
12082	62	19	old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
12083	70	22	gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he
12084	69	19	was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching
12085	63	14	his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.' 'What for?' says the old
12086	67	18	governor. 'What business is that of yours,' says the devil, getting
12087	68	17	mad,--'I want to use him.' 'Take him,' says the governor--and by the
12088	69	21	Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the Asiatic cholera before
12089	70	21	he got through with him, I'll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look
12090	71	19	sharp--ain't you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let's get
12091	21	7	the whale alongside."

12093	69	20	"I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask,
12094	66	18	when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
12095	47	12	towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."
12096	0	0	
12097	71	23	"Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes? Did

12100	66	18	"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
12101	71	21	Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
12102	45	15	the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"
12103	0	0	
12104	70	20	"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn't the devil live
12105	66	22	for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see
12106	67	21	any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a
12107	67	20	latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he can
12108	48	11	crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"

12114	65	18	along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that
12115	68	22	wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age. Nor all the coopers in creation

12118	71	22	"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you

12120	67	21	he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going

12133	72	22	"I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black eyes
12134	71	22	that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin again for
12135	68	21	a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and
12136	70	21	hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil,
12137	62	20	Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil? Who's afraid of
12138	66	17	him, except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put him in
12139	64	21	double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
12140	70	21	people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
12141	51	14	kidnapped, he'd roast for him? There's a governor!"

12145	71	21	"Do I suppose it? You'll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now
12146	70	24	to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious
12147	67	18	going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say--Look
12148	71	20	here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord
12149	70	21	I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
12150	72	20	and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short
12151	68	19	off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds
12152	70	22	himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak off without the poor
12153	51	17	satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs."
12154	0	0	
12155	44	11	"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"
12156	0	0	
12157	66	17	"Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?"
12158	0	0	
12159	71	21	"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?"
12160	0	0	
12161	44	14	"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."
12162	0	0	
12163	72	24	The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
12164	69	24	fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing
12165	4	1	him.

12167	68	18	"Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this right
12168	52	17	whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's."
12169	0	0	
12170	71	22	In good time, Flask's saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
12171	71	22	leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the counterpoise of
12172	71	23	both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
12173	68	24	well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke's head, you go
12174	71	21	over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant's and you come
12175	67	19	back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
12176	71	21	trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
12177	40	10	and then you will float light and right.
12178	0	0	
12179	69	20	In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
12180	68	21	ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
12181	72	21	case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off
12182	71	23	whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and
12183	71	19	hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is
12184	67	19	called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case,
12185	66	19	had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and
12186	68	22	the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
12187	23	8	overburdening panniers.
12188	0	0	
12189	69	21	Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever
12190	70	20	and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
12191	72	21	hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow;
12192	64	20	while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only to
12193	66	17	blend with, and lengthen Ahab's. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish
12194	66	21	speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
12195	7	1	things.

12202	68	21	Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
12203	36	11	join them, and lay together our own.
12204	0	0	
12205	69	20	Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
12206	72	20	Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly
12207	71	19	hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all
12208	68	23	the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between
12209	71	23	them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this
12210	71	21	moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one
12211	71	19	to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:--where, I should like
12212	68	21	to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology
12213	10	3	than here?
12214	0	0	
12215	72	21	In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
12216	72	25	heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain
12217	72	17	mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's sadly
12218	71	21	lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head. As you behold
12219	68	24	it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point
12220	67	19	of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is
12221	67	20	heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,
12222	71	23	giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what
12223	53	15	the fishermen technically call a "grey-headed whale."
12224	0	0	
12225	72	22	Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the two
12226	67	20	most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of
12227	68	21	the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if you
12228	69	21	narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
12229	69	22	fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
12230	22	8	magnitude of the head.
12231	0	0	
12232	67	22	Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is
12233	69	22	plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
12234	70	21	than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale's
12235	64	18	eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for
12236	69	22	yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects
12237	66	21	through your ears. You would find that you could only command some
12238	71	22	thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
12239	67	22	and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking
12240	70	21	straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not
12241	67	23	be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
12242	69	20	behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
12243	72	19	same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the
12244	43	12	front of a man--what, indeed, but his eyes?
12245	0	0	
12246	71	22	Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
12247	69	22	are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
12248	70	25	produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of
12249	71	22	the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
12250	70	24	solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
12251	63	18	two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the
12252	71	22	impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,
12253	64	20	must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
12254	69	21	picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and
12255	72	21	nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world
12256	69	18	from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the
12257	68	21	whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct
12258	70	21	windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale's
12259	68	20	eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be
12260	51	17	remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.
12261	0	0	
12262	69	21	A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
12263	69	22	visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
12264	70	21	hint. So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
12265	64	19	is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
12266	67	23	whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one's experience
12267	71	22	will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
12268	66	21	things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively,
12269	67	21	and completely, to examine any two things--however large or however
12270	71	22	small--at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side
12271	71	24	by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two
12272	69	19	objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
12273	67	21	order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
12274	69	21	bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
12275	68	19	consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,
12276	69	21	in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
12277	72	20	comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same
12278	69	23	moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one
12279	66	22	side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he
12280	67	21	can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
12281	72	22	simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems
12282	71	21	in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this
12283	11	4	comparison.
12284	0	0	
12285	68	20	It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
12286	68	22	extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
12287	65	22	beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
12288	67	16	frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
12289	65	19	proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
12290	70	24	divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.
12291	0	0	
12292	69	25	But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
12293	66	21	entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads
12294	70	22	for hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
12295	68	21	whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
12296	67	21	wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
12297	66	21	respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
12298	70	20	between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has
12299	70	22	an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
12300	67	23	over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
12301	0	0	
12302	67	22	Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
12303	72	20	world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which
12304	67	20	is smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of
12305	68	22	Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
12306	66	18	cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
12307	65	17	hearing? Not at all.--Why then do you try to "enlarge" your mind?
12308	13	5	Subtilize it.
12309	0	0	
12310	71	21	Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
12311	71	20	over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
12312	70	21	by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
12313	68	19	that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
12314	70	19	might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But
12315	71	22	let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What
12316	67	23	a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
12317	68	20	lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
12318	14	4	bridal satins.
12319	0	0	
12320	68	21	But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
12321	71	21	like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one
12322	69	23	end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
12323	71	21	and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,
12324	68	20	alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
12325	71	21	spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,
12326	70	22	when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
12327	67	21	suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
12328	69	17	straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a
12329	70	21	ship's jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of
12330	68	18	sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his
12331	70	21	jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
12332	71	21	reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
12333	4	1	him.
12334	0	0	
12335	66	20	In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised
12336	71	22	artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
12337	69	20	the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
12338	63	19	with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
12339	62	16	including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
12340	0	0	
12341	70	21	With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
12342	69	20	anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the other
12343	70	22	work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
12344	68	23	are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances
12345	70	18	the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
12346	67	20	rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
12347	72	21	stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two
12348	70	19	teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled
12349	72	23	after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and
12350	43	15	piled away like joists for building houses.

12357	72	20	Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale's
12358	5	2	head.
12359	0	0	
12360	69	22	As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a
12361	72	22	Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
12362	68	22	so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather inelegant
12363	69	24	resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an
12364	70	21	old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker's last. And
12365	67	19	in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with
12366	69	17	the swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her
12367	8	2	progeny.
12368	0	0	
12369	71	25	But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
12370	72	22	aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
12371	68	23	look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head
12372	68	22	for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
12373	67	22	sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
12374	67	19	crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass--this green,
12375	65	15	barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the "crown," and the
12376	66	19	Southern fishers the "bonnet" of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes
12377	71	23	solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
12378	72	19	with a bird's nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live
12379	66	19	crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
12380	70	22	sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
12381	68	20	technical term "crown" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
12382	69	20	take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
12383	69	22	diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
12384	72	21	him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very
12385	71	22	sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip!
12386	67	19	what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's
12387	71	24	measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout
12388	53	16	that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.
12389	0	0	
12390	69	21	A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
12391	65	21	The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an
12392	72	24	important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes
12393	70	21	caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold,
12394	70	22	we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should
12395	70	22	take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the
12396	71	22	road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a
12397	70	22	pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while
12398	71	20	these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half
12399	68	21	vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a
12400	62	17	side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown
12401	68	22	bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily
12402	66	21	mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,
12403	61	16	through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose
12404	71	23	intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through
12405	72	21	the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they
12406	70	23	stand in their natural order, there are certain curious marks, curves,
12407	72	23	hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age,
12408	72	21	as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty of this
12409	70	23	criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
12410	72	22	probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater
12411	65	20	age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable.
12412	0	0	
12413	67	24	In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
12414	71	20	concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
12415	69	18	"whiskers" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, "hogs' bristles"; a
12416	68	21	third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
12417	71	22	"There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
12418	66	20	upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth."
12419	0	0	
12420	0	0	
12421	70	18	*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
12422	68	22	rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
12423	61	20	upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these
12424	67	21	tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
12425	12	5	countenance.

12428	68	16	As every one knows, these same "hogs' bristles," "fins," "whiskers,"
12429	71	21	"blinds," or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
12430	69	20	other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
12431	71	23	long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne's time that the bone was
12432	70	20	in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those
12433	68	22	ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as
12434	71	21	you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
12435	69	21	nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
12436	31	10	tent spread over the same bone.

12438	72	19	But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
12439	68	22	in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
12440	68	23	colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think
12441	63	22	you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
12442	70	22	thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
12443	67	20	Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
12444	71	22	mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
12445	71	23	it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
12446	71	22	should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that
12447	14	6	amount of oil.
12448	0	0	
12449	64	19	Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
12450	67	18	with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
12451	72	20	different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no great
12452	68	19	well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a
12453	71	20	lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any
12454	70	20	of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a
12455	70	21	tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm
12456	15	5	Whale only one.
12457	0	0	
12458	72	24	Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
12459	72	22	together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
12460	30	8	not be very long in following.
12461	0	0	
12462	71	21	Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there? It is the same
12463	67	21	he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem
12464	67	22	now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
12465	71	23	placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the
12466	72	22	other head's expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident
12467	68	20	against the vessel's side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not
12468	68	25	this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in
12469	69	21	facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm
12470	72	23	Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.

12476	0	0	
12477	65	20	Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have
12478	70	20	you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its front
12479	72	24	aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate
12480	68	23	it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,
12481	66	22	intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged
12482	71	24	there. Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle
12483	69	23	this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of
12484	72	20	the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be
12485	30	9	found in all recorded history.
12486	0	0	
12487	70	22	You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,
12488	69	19	the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
12489	72	21	water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
12490	71	20	backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
12491	72	25	receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely
12492	70	22	under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
12493	70	24	were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has
12494	70	21	no external nose; and that what nose he has--his spout hole--is on the
12495	68	23	top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
12496	66	18	of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.
12497	66	20	Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm
12498	68	21	Whale's head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender
12499	71	24	prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider
12500	70	18	that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of
12501	66	20	the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you
12502	70	23	get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial
12503	69	22	development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.
12504	71	20	Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise
12505	71	25	the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of
12506	72	20	the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.
12507	72	24	In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the
12508	70	19	body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head;
12509	69	22	but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so
12510	69	20	thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not
12511	70	20	handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by
12512	69	19	the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though
12513	71	22	the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs. I do not
12514	37	10	think that any sensation lurks in it.
12515	0	0	
12516	71	23	Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
12517	70	18	chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
12518	68	20	sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
12519	68	19	contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold
12520	67	20	there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest
12521	71	21	and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
12522	68	20	would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
12523	69	22	itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But
12524	65	18	supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that
12525	67	18	as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
12526	71	21	capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,
12527	65	20	as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too,
12528	68	22	the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
12529	72	24	altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out
12530	70	23	of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;
12531	66	23	considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically
12532	71	20	occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there
12533	70	22	may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with
12534	68	24	the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and
12535	72	20	contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to
12536	70	21	which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.
12537	0	0	
12538	67	20	Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
12539	69	18	wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
12540	70	25	mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
12541	66	20	is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest
12542	60	19	insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the
12543	69	23	specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
12544	72	24	expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable
12545	60	20	braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant
12546	71	20	incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale
12547	69	22	stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic
12548	70	25	with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For
12549	69	24	unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist
12550	66	18	in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to
12551	70	19	encounter; how small the chances for the provincials then? What befell
12552	60	18	the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's veil at Lais?

12559	71	21	Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
12560	70	23	know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
12561	5	2	upon.
12562	0	0	
12563	66	20	Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
12564	70	24	inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower
12565	69	19	is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
12566	71	20	unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
12567	70	23	expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
12568	71	25	forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
12569	70	22	almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
12570	36	11	wall of a thick tendinous substance.

12573	63	23	*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
12574	69	24	mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
12575	70	18	solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
12576	69	25	steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
12577	6	2	sides.
12578	0	0	
12579	0	0	
12580	68	21	The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb
12581	64	18	of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
12582	69	22	infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
12583	71	20	extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great
12584	70	22	Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is
12585	70	19	mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms
12586	65	22	innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
12587	69	22	wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished
12588	71	19	with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun
12589	72	22	of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages;
12590	69	20	namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid,
12591	69	25	and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed
12592	70	22	in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly
12593	68	23	fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to
12594	65	19	concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the
12595	65	20	first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale's
12596	70	21	case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
12597	68	23	unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
12598	72	22	dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business
12599	25	8	of securing what you can.

12601	65	19	I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun
12602	69	22	was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
12603	72	23	possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the
12604	72	22	lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale's
12605	5	2	case.
12606	0	0	
12607	66	20	It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
12608	71	22	embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since--as
12609	70	22	has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third of the whole
12610	72	19	length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for
12611	68	21	a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
12612	70	20	of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's
12613	5	2	side.
12614	0	0	
12615	72	23	As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought close
12616	72	23	to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
12617	71	23	magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
12618	69	21	untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
12619	72	23	invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
12620	70	24	is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by
12621	69	23	the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side,
12622	49	17	make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
12623	0	0	
12624	72	21	Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and--in
12625	66	21	this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
12626	40	12	Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.

12633	70	22	Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
12634	68	21	posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the
12635	67	20	part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried
12636	68	17	with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
12637	71	19	travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that
12638	71	18	it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
12639	71	16	is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
12640	69	20	the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
12641	69	21	lands on the summit of the head. There--still high elevated above the
12642	72	22	rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish
12643	69	22	Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
12644	70	19	short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches
12645	69	21	for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business
12646	69	24	he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
12647	68	19	sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time
12648	71	25	this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
12649	72	22	a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other
12650	67	17	end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three
12651	72	20	alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian,
12652	70	21	to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this
12653	71	22	pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun,
12654	70	21	till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the
12655	70	22	whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail
12656	66	18	of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted
12657	71	22	vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large
12658	70	23	tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through the same round until
12659	69	20	the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to
12660	72	22	ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun,
12661	50	16	until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.
12662	0	0	
12663	68	22	Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
12664	72	20	several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a
12665	72	22	queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,
12666	69	21	was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed
12667	68	19	hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the
12668	69	23	place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil
12669	72	24	One himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
12670	71	20	reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden,
12671	68	21	as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up--my God! poor
12672	65	21	Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
12673	71	21	dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with
12674	50	15	a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
12675	0	0	
12676	71	23	"Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
12677	69	19	came to his senses. "Swing the bucket this way!" and putting one foot
12678	70	20	into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
12679	67	19	itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
12680	65	24	before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime,
12681	71	23	there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before
12682	70	22	lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,
12683	70	24	as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
12684	71	24	the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
12685	27	6	depth to which he had sunk.
12686	0	0	
12687	70	21	At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
12688	68	19	the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles--a
12689	69	21	sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,
12690	68	23	one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with
12691	70	20	a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
12692	69	23	reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
12693	69	22	upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
12694	71	21	on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
12695	20	7	motions of the head.
12696	0	0	
12697	70	21	"Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
12698	68	19	holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
12699	69	22	would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
12700	68	19	rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
12701	57	20	buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.

12703	71	22	"In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ramming home a cartridge
12704	72	19	there?--Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on
12705	33	9	top of his head? Avast, will ye!"

12707	65	20	"Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting of a
12708	7	2	rocket.

12710	66	20	Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
12711	71	23	dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the
12712	70	20	suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
12713	67	18	copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now over the
12714	71	21	sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a thick mist of
12715	70	19	spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
12716	72	23	buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!
12717	68	21	But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away, when a naked figure
12718	64	18	with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
12719	69	19	hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my
12720	71	25	brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the
12721	72	23	side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and
12722	71	22	no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now
12723	68	21	jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.
12724	0	0	
12725	71	20	"Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
12726	69	20	overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
12727	69	19	upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
12728	34	9	forth from the grass over a grave.
12729	0	0	
12730	71	20	"Both! both!--it is both!"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and
12731	68	22	soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
12732	68	19	with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the
12733	69	20	waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
12734	56	17	long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
12735	0	0	
12736	67	19	Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after
12737	65	20	the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
12738	70	22	side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
12739	68	15	dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
12740	68	21	and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
12741	69	17	thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
12742	68	21	was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had
12743	69	19	thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
12744	71	21	somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
12745	71	21	the good old way--head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was
12746	35	11	doing as well as could be expected.
12747	0	0	
12748	72	23	And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,
12749	66	20	the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
12750	68	20	accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
12751	68	20	hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
12752	70	21	Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,
12753	18	5	riding and rowing.

12755	68	22	I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to
12756	72	23	seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either
12757	70	24	seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an accident
12758	64	17	which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the
12759	67	21	Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
12760	19	4	Sperm Whale's well.
12761	0	0	
12762	71	22	But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
12763	70	20	the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
12764	71	21	most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
12765	70	22	a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
12766	72	22	all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been
12767	68	20	nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense
12768	69	22	tendinous wall of the well--a double welded, hammered substance, as I
12769	70	23	have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which
12770	71	20	sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this
12771	68	21	substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the
12772	69	21	other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank
12773	69	24	very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance
12774	71	21	for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it
12775	34	10	was a running delivery, so it was.
12776	0	0	
12777	68	22	Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
12778	66	19	perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
12779	69	21	spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
12780	71	22	and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
12781	72	26	recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey
12782	70	21	in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that
12783	65	21	leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed.
12784	69	21	How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's honey head, and
12785	23	7	sweetly perished there?

12792	68	20	To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
12793	72	21	Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as
12794	70	23	yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
12795	66	20	Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,
12796	68	23	or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the
12797	68	19	Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats
12798	67	23	of the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces
12799	67	17	of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the
12800	66	23	modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and
12801	66	21	his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
12802	66	21	phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
12803	72	27	though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these
12804	72	20	two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things;
12805	21	8	I achieve what I can.
12806	0	0	
12807	68	23	Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.
12808	65	19	He has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most
12809	67	23	conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
12810	72	22	finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that its
12811	66	21	entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
12812	69	22	the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,
12813	71	24	cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
12814	69	22	to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in
12815	72	23	keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose
12816	69	20	from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless,
12817	65	22	Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so
12818	67	20	stately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were
12819	69	22	hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A
12820	72	25	nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical
12821	66	23	voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble
12822	69	22	conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a
12823	71	22	nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon
12824	71	22	obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.
12825	0	0	
12826	69	22	In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
12827	70	18	be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This
12828	18	6	aspect is sublime.
12829	0	0	
12830	69	21	In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
12831	72	21	morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a
12832	71	22	touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the
12833	69	20	elephant's brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as
12834	71	22	that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees.
12835	69	18	It signifies--"God: done this day by my hand." But in most creatures,
12836	69	20	nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine
12837	64	19	land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like
12838	72	20	Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise so high, and descend so low, that the
12839	69	23	eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all
12840	69	22	above them in the forehead's wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered
12841	69	17	thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the
12842	68	17	snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and
12843	71	21	mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified,
12844	70	20	that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the Deity and the
12845	71	21	dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living
12846	71	26	nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is
12847	70	23	revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper;
12848	64	21	nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with
12849	68	17	riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.
12850	66	19	Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way
12851	66	25	viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you
12852	67	22	plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the
12853	62	18	forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.
12854	0	0	
12855	68	19	But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written
12856	64	21	a book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his
12857	68	23	doing nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his
12858	71	20	pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale
12859	67	22	been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by
12860	68	22	their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,
12861	63	21	because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no
12862	69	23	tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
12863	72	24	protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure
12864	70	16	back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly
12865	68	22	enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted
12866	70	20	hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, the great Sperm Whale
12867	14	3	shall lord it.

12871	67	21	face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
12872	70	21	fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could
12873	70	22	not read the simplest peasant's face in its profounder and more subtle
12874	70	24	meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of
12875	70	21	the Sperm Whale's brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you

12883	72	20	If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
12884	69	23	brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.

12886	70	21	In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
12887	71	20	in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as
12888	69	24	the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
12889	68	23	base. But in life--as we have elsewhere seen--this inclined plane is
12890	70	22	angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
12891	71	17	mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
12892	72	19	bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater--in
12893	67	20	another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
12894	72	20	depth--reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain. The brain is at
12895	66	21	least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden
12896	68	21	away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
12897	65	25	amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it
12898	70	21	secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
12899	69	19	that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
12900	72	20	of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange
12901	71	23	folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more
12902	72	21	in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part
12903	39	13	of him as the seat of his intelligence.
12904	0	0	
12905	70	21	It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in
12906	69	23	the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
12907	68	23	true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The
12908	72	20	whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common
12909	6	1	world.
12910	0	0	
12911	69	22	If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
12912	65	16	of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
12913	70	22	resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
12914	70	21	the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down
12915	68	21	to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls, and you would
12916	69	21	involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on
12917	67	21	one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say--This
12918	66	21	man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,
12919	69	23	considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
12920	68	19	power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
12921	60	19	exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.
12922	0	0	
12923	71	23	But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain, you
12924	71	27	deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
12925	64	21	for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine,
12926	68	20	you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung
12927	69	21	necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
12928	71	23	skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely
12929	67	23	undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it
12930	69	22	the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
12931	69	23	pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
12932	71	23	the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the
12933	69	22	beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have
12934	71	22	omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
12935	71	22	cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man's
12936	70	23	character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
12937	68	23	your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine
12938	72	23	never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the
12939	70	20	firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.
12940	0	0	
12941	70	18	Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
12942	71	21	cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
12943	68	21	the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
12944	71	22	eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As
12945	71	23	it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but
12946	70	24	for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,
12947	72	20	this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance--the
12948	68	19	spinal cord--as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.
12949	69	19	And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain's
12950	64	19	cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost
12951	70	22	equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be
12952	69	23	unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically?
12953	69	20	For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
12954	66	21	brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
12955	29	9	magnitude of his spinal cord.
12956	0	0	
12957	68	21	But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
12958	71	23	would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
12959	70	21	Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
12960	67	22	of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
12961	72	23	convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this
12962	70	20	high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale.
12963	70	23	And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to
12964	5	1	know.

12974	67	20	At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and

12979	69	24	For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
12980	71	22	While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
12981	70	21	boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
12982	26	7	bows instead of the stern.

12984	70	19	"What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to something

12987	70	16	"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he's
12988	71	23	coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see that big
12989	71	20	tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water. Oh! he's all
12990	22	5	right, is the Yarman."

12992	69	20	"Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
12993	41	13	He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."

12995	70	25	However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
12996	67	19	whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
12997	69	21	proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
12998	66	20	really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
12999	55	17	indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.

13001	66	20	As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
13002	68	19	heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
13003	67	24	soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
13004	66	21	turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
13005	64	18	remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
13006	68	20	profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
13007	68	18	single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding
13008	70	18	by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically
13009	70	21	called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name of
13010	23	7	Jungfrau or the Virgin.

13012	68	22	His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
13013	67	21	ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
13014	71	20	mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
13015	68	23	without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed
13016	57	19	round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.

13018	68	21	Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German

13020	70	24	keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger,
13021	70	21	they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind,
13022	70	18	rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness.
13023	69	22	They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great
13024	28	9	wide parchment upon the sea.
13025	0	0	
13026	67	19	Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
13027	69	17	humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
13028	72	24	by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted
13029	71	22	with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged
13030	71	24	to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for
13031	69	22	such venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck
13032	69	22	to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him,
13033	69	23	because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one,
13034	67	19	like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was
13035	69	18	short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush,
13036	68	18	and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean
13037	66	22	commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried
13038	53	16	extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble.

13040	69	19	"Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm
13041	67	20	afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse
13042	70	17	winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It's the first foul wind
13043	72	22	I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before?
13044	34	8	it must be, he's lost his tiller."

13046	69	23	As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
13047	69	20	load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
13048	71	19	way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
13049	70	24	turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
13050	69	20	wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost
13051	69	20	that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.

13053	69	19	"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded
13054	61	18	arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
13055	0	0	
13056	69	17	"Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck. "Give way, or the
13057	22	6	German will have him."
13058	0	0	
13059	66	21	With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
13060	69	21	one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
13061	69	22	valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
13062	67	21	going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit
13063	71	20	for the time. At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the three
13064	72	19	German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick's
13065	67	20	boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign
13066	67	18	rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being already so
13067	66	20	nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they
13068	70	23	could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite
13069	71	22	confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding
13070	49	16	gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.
13071	0	0	
13072	72	21	"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks and dares
13073	71	21	me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!"--then
13074	62	17	in his old intense whisper--"Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!"
13075	0	0	
13076	67	17	"I tell ye what it is, men"--cried Stubb to his crew--"it's against
13077	59	20	my religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that villainous
13078	67	19	Yarman--Pull--won't ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do
13079	66	17	ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come,
13080	70	18	why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who's that been dropping an
13081	72	22	anchor overboard--we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed. Halloo, here's
13082	69	16	grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast there's
13083	72	17	budding. This won't do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of
13084	38	10	it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"
13085	0	0	
13086	68	17	"Oh! see the suds he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down--"What
13087	65	18	a hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log! Oh! my lads, DO
13088	67	16	spring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--baked
13089	71	16	clams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he's a hundred barreller--don't
13090	70	17	lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see that Yarman--Oh, won't ye pull for
13091	67	16	your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger! Don't ye love sperm?
13092	72	20	There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a bank!--a whole bank! The bank
13093	60	15	of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's that Yarman about now?"
13094	0	0	
13095	71	20	At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
13096	67	21	advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view
13097	63	20	of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically
13098	67	19	accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
13099	0	0	
13100	70	16	"The unmannerly Dutch dogger!" cried Stubb. "Pull now, men, like fifty
13101	71	21	thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d'ye say,
13102	69	22	Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
13103	46	13	for the honour of old Gayhead? What d'ye say?"
13104	0	0	
13105	46	13	"I say, pull like god-dam,"--cried the Indian.
13106	0	0	
13107	70	20	Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod's
13108	63	19	three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
13109	67	24	momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of
13110	68	20	the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
13111	72	22	proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry
13112	70	19	of, "There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with
13113	27	8	the Yarman! Sail over him!"
13114	0	0	
13115	66	20	But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
13116	70	20	their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
13117	72	22	a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade
13118	69	19	of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free
13119	67	20	his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's boat was nigh to
13120	72	20	capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;--that was
13121	69	19	a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a
13122	72	18	mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter.
13123	68	22	An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale's
13124	66	19	immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the
13125	27	8	foaming swell that he made.
13126	0	0	
13127	68	20	It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was
13128	67	23	now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
13129	66	22	tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
13130	72	17	fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight,
13131	69	19	and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the
13132	70	22	sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I
13133	69	19	seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the
13134	70	21	air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a
13135	70	22	voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear
13136	72	21	of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him;
13137	68	22	he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle,
13138	72	21	and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his
13139	70	22	amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to
13140	37	12	appal the stoutest man who so pitied.
13141	0	0	
13142	67	21	Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's
13143	71	22	boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick
13144	72	22	chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart,
13145	42	14	ere the last chance would for ever escape.
13146	0	0	
13147	72	22	But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
13148	71	23	tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to their feet,
13149	71	23	and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and
13150	68	23	darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket
13151	69	22	irons entered the whale. Blinding vapours of foam and white-fire! The
13152	67	18	three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, bumped
13153	68	18	the German's aside with such force, that both Derick and his baffled
13154	71	23	harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keels.
13155	0	0	
13156	66	17	"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing
13157	66	16	glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be picked up presently--all
13158	70	18	right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you know--relieve
13159	72	21	distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
13160	72	23	sunbeam! Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad
13161	72	22	cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on
13162	70	19	a plain--makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that
13163	67	21	way; and there's danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
13164	68	18	hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy
13165	68	19	Jones--all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale
13166	30	10	carries the everlasting mail!"
13167	0	0	
13168	63	18	But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
13169	69	21	tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round
13170	67	22	the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
13171	68	23	while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
13172	66	20	soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
13173	63	18	caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
13174	69	20	last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
13175	71	20	the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue--the
13176	69	21	gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
13177	67	20	sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound,
13178	71	25	for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more
13179	70	22	line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have
13180	72	19	been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this "holding on," as it
13181	68	17	is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
13182	71	21	the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising
13183	72	23	again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril
13184	67	20	of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the
13185	71	21	best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken
13186	72	24	whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the
13187	72	21	enormous surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than
13188	67	20	2000 square feet--the pressure of the water is immense. We all know
13189	72	23	what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even
13190	70	21	here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale,
13191	72	22	bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at
13192	71	24	least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated
13193	69	18	it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns,
13194	29	8	and stores, and men on board.
13195	0	0	
13196	68	19	As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
13197	67	21	into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
13198	71	19	sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
13199	67	19	what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
13200	71	19	placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
13201	71	23	agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
13202	69	20	Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan
13203	71	20	was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and
13204	68	20	to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was
13205	71	19	once so triumphantly said--"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
13206	72	19	or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot
13207	66	20	hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as
13208	68	20	straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
13209	71	21	he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!" This the creature? this he? Oh!
13210	68	16	that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength
13211	70	22	of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the
13212	64	20	mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!
13213	0	0	
13214	68	19	In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
13215	67	21	sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
13216	68	19	enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the
13217	71	22	wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
13218	0	0	
13219	70	16	"Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
13220	67	17	vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
13221	69	20	magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
13222	70	21	oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
13223	68	20	from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
13224	71	22	upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
13225	28	9	scared from it into the sea.
13226	0	0	
13227	56	16	"Haul in! Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."
13228	0	0	
13229	69	18	The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth
13230	67	21	could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
13231	66	20	dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
13232	30	6	ship's lengths of the hunters.
13233	0	0	
13234	72	24	His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
13235	71	23	there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
13236	72	22	when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
13237	69	25	certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities
13238	71	23	it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so
13239	65	20	that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly
13240	71	22	drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is
13241	69	23	heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance
13242	69	22	below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant
13243	68	19	streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant
13244	72	24	and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and
13245	69	24	bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will
13246	70	20	flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible
13247	70	20	hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously
13248	66	19	drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,
13249	69	18	they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept
13250	70	22	continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only
13251	69	22	at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the
13252	72	22	air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him
13253	70	18	had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was
13254	10	4	untouched.
13255	0	0	
13256	69	21	As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
13257	67	18	his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
13258	70	23	revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
13259	66	18	beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the
13260	70	19	noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes
13261	71	22	had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
13262	70	20	But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his
13263	72	21	blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the
13264	70	21	gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the
13265	72	22	solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.
13266	70	19	Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely
13267	72	23	discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the
13268	6	1	flank.
13269	0	0	
13270	63	16	"A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."
13271	0	0	
13272	51	13	"Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"
13273	0	0	
13274	63	19	But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an
13275	72	22	ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than
13276	71	20	sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury
13277	71	17	blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews
13278	69	19	all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the
13279	68	16	bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by
13280	67	17	loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
13281	71	19	made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
13282	65	19	then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up
13283	69	19	the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most
13284	68	20	piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water
13285	71	19	is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled
13286	62	16	melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
13287	50	13	ground--so the last long dying spout of the whale.
13288	0	0	
13289	69	21	Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
13290	72	21	showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,
13291	70	20	by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
13292	71	23	that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a
13293	70	18	few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when
13294	66	17	the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was
13295	69	18	strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain
13296	67	20	that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the
13297	7	2	bottom.
13298	0	0	
13299	69	19	It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
13300	72	22	the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,
13301	69	19	on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
13302	68	23	harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,
13303	69	20	with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any
13304	65	22	kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been
13305	66	21	some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
13306	67	23	the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
13307	69	22	lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
13308	71	19	the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And
13309	68	20	when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before
13310	23	9	America was discovered.
13311	0	0	
13312	65	20	What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
13313	65	19	cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further
13314	70	21	discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
13315	70	20	to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.
13316	72	21	However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the
13317	71	19	last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship
13318	70	20	would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the
13319	71	18	body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was
13320	72	22	the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and
13321	71	22	cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime
13322	70	21	everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the
13323	67	21	deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship
13324	67	19	groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and
13325	68	21	cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation.
13326	68	22	In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable
13327	65	17	fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low
13328	69	19	had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all
13329	72	24	approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to
13330	65	19	the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.
13331	0	0	
13332	72	16	"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body, "don't be in such
13333	71	19	a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go
13334	71	20	for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run
13335	69	21	one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains."

13337	68	23	"Knife? Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy
13338	71	23	hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
13339	68	18	at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were
13340	67	20	given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific
13341	70	18	snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
13342	0	0	
13343	68	21	Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
13344	67	22	Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
13345	64	20	accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
13346	64	21	buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
13347	64	18	surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
13348	69	22	broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
13349	70	22	bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
13350	69	20	this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
13351	70	22	sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it
13352	69	18	is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
13353	67	20	noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of
13354	72	21	life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant
13355	25	9	heroes do sometimes sink.
13356	0	0	
13357	68	20	Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
13358	71	20	accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
13359	72	23	Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
13360	67	21	no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;
13361	71	23	his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
13362	67	20	incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances
13363	70	21	where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
13364	62	21	again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this
13365	65	24	is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
13366	72	25	magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could
13367	69	19	hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among
13368	72	20	the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they
13369	72	19	fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone
13370	71	21	down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.

13372	71	18	It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
13373	72	23	the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
13374	65	17	her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
13375	63	22	belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its
13376	70	20	incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout is so
13377	69	19	similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is often
13378	69	20	mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in
13379	69	22	valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail,
13380	69	22	made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to
13381	38	11	leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

13397	67	21	have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection

13401	66	19	The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and
13402	69	22	to the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale
13403	72	21	attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those
13404	67	19	were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to
13405	68	19	succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders. Every one
13406	72	22	knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda,
13407	67	21	the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as
13408	70	20	Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince
13409	71	22	of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered
13410	66	22	and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely
13411	69	21	achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this
13412	69	19	Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this
13413	71	21	Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast,
13414	72	22	in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton
13415	72	20	of a whale, which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to
13416	72	21	be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans
13417	67	21	took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What
13418	70	19	seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is this:
13419	38	11	it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
13420	0	0	
13421	72	25	Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some supposed
13422	72	21	to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of St. George and
13423	69	22	the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many
13424	69	19	old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and
13425	71	22	often stand for each other. "Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
13426	67	22	dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale;
13427	70	21	in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it
13428	68	18	would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but
13429	67	22	encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle
13430	72	20	with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a
13431	71	20	Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly
13432	14	5	up to a whale.
13433	0	0	
13434	65	19	Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though
13435	67	23	the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
13436	70	22	represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted
13437	71	22	on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance
13438	71	20	of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;
13439	71	21	and considering that as in Perseus' case, St. George's whale might have
13440	71	23	crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
13441	69	21	ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
13442	68	22	bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
13443	67	19	with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
13444	72	21	hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In
13445	72	18	fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will
13446	70	19	fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by
13447	70	22	name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and
13448	68	15	both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or
13449	72	21	fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even
13450	71	21	a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we
13451	67	22	harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
13452	68	20	of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable
13453	67	21	company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a
13454	69	22	whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with
13455	68	22	disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
13456	58	17	much better entitled to St. George's decoration than they.

13458	65	19	Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
13459	69	23	remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
13460	67	21	antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good
13461	66	16	deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether
13462	71	20	that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere
13463	65	21	appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed,
13464	69	22	from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
13465	70	21	whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I
13466	30	10	claim him for one of our clan.
13467	0	0	
13468	65	19	But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
13469	70	22	Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
13470	70	21	ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa; certainly
13471	72	20	they are very similar. If I claim the demigod then, why not the prophet?
13472	0	0	
13473	70	22	Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
13474	72	22	roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal
13475	72	21	kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
13476	71	20	short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now
13477	71	22	to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one
13478	72	23	of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine
13479	68	18	Vishnoo himself for our Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
13480	70	22	earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.
13481	72	21	When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate
13482	68	23	the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to
13483	68	20	Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books,
13484	69	26	whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before
13485	63	21	beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
13486	68	20	something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
13487	63	20	Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
13488	71	21	incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
13489	71	22	rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even
13490	48	16	as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?

13492	72	21	Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a member-roll

13500	72	23	Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
13501	72	21	preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical
13502	71	21	story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks
13503	70	20	and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,
13504	70	22	equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the
13505	67	21	dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
13506	49	13	traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
13507	0	0	
13508	69	23	One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
13509	65	20	story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
13510	71	24	embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
13511	66	21	Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true
13512	68	20	with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
13513	66	20	varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this
13514	69	17	saying, "A penny roll would choke him"; his swallow is so very small.
13515	67	20	But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is ready. It is not
13516	68	19	necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the
13517	71	20	whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And
13518	63	20	this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the
13519	67	21	Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and
13520	65	18	comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have
13521	71	19	ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right
13522	19	6	Whale is toothless.
13523	0	0	
13524	68	19	Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
13525	71	20	want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
13526	70	22	reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices. But
13527	71	25	this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
13528	68	22	supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
13529	70	22	DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
13530	68	20	their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has
13531	67	20	been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was
13532	72	21	thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape
13533	70	23	to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head;
13534	64	18	and, I would add, possibly called "The Whale," as some craft are
13535	72	19	nowadays christened the "Shark," the "Gull," the "Eagle." Nor have there
13536	72	25	been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned
13537	67	22	in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag
13538	70	19	of wind--which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a
13539	69	21	watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But
13540	68	20	he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I
13541	69	21	remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean
13542	72	23	Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'
13543	67	20	journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three
13544	71	23	days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast.
13545	12	3	How is that?
13546	0	0	
13547	72	20	But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
13548	70	20	short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the
13549	69	22	way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through
13550	65	21	the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the
13551	71	24	Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete
13552	72	24	circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris
13553	68	22	waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to
13554	71	24	swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of Good Hope
13555	71	22	at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great
13556	67	22	headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make
13557	22	7	modern history a liar.
13558	0	0	
13559	66	20	But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
13560	72	24	foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
13561	69	19	that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
13562	68	21	sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
13563	68	22	abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a
13564	70	24	Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah's going to Nineveh
13565	67	25	via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of
13566	68	19	the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly
13567	72	23	enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And
13568	71	23	some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris's Voyages,
13569	72	24	speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was
13570	45	15	a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.

13577	63	20	To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
13578	64	20	anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
13579	70	26	analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it
13580	70	21	to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
13581	67	23	be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are
13582	71	21	hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
13583	68	24	make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing
13584	65	19	his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
13585	72	24	disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling
13586	65	19	under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the
13587	71	24	unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from
13588	67	22	the craft's bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some
13589	68	21	particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.

13595	67	18	Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost. By great
13596	66	22	exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
13597	71	22	stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
13598	68	19	flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
13599	66	22	planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
13600	68	21	imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But
13601	68	20	to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
13602	28	10	furious. What then remained?
13603	0	0	
13604	69	21	Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
13605	71	22	countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
13606	72	23	none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
13607	70	20	sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It
13608	65	20	is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand
13609	69	21	fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
13610	71	22	accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
13611	72	24	headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve
13612	68	17	feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon,
13613	71	23	and also of a lighter material--pine. It is furnished with a small rope
13614	72	20	called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to
13615	23	6	the hand after darting.
13616	0	0	
13617	70	22	But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
13618	68	20	the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it
13619	67	18	is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,
13620	70	23	on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
13621	71	22	compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a
13622	72	22	general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any
13623	28	8	pitchpoling comes into play.
13624	0	0	
13625	71	23	Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
13626	70	26	equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
13627	71	19	in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
13628	72	21	flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
13629	67	17	Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its
13630	69	17	length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up
13631	69	22	the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his
13632	72	20	grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before
13633	65	18	his waistband's middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering
13634	68	18	him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby
13635	67	21	elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his
13636	66	21	palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
13637	70	19	balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless
13638	66	18	impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
13639	63	20	distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of
13640	41	11	sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

13644	67	23	Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,
13645	68	19	Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we'd drink
13646	66	20	round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew choice punch in the
13647	71	20	spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
13648	14	3	living stuff."

13650	70	25	Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
13651	66	20	the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
13652	63	20	leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is
13653	67	16	slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and
13654	31	9	mutely watches the monster die.

13661	71	21	That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of ages
13662	68	23	before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea,
13663	65	17	and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
13664	69	18	many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
13665	66	21	thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
13666	69	17	whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this should
13667	68	20	be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter
13668	69	19	minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.
13669	64	17	1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings
13670	69	21	are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is surely a
13671	17	4	noteworthy thing.
13672	0	0	
13673	68	20	Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
13674	65	19	contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
13675	72	21	gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is
13676	71	20	combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod
13677	70	24	might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface.
13678	66	20	But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular
13679	68	19	lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by inhaling the
13680	66	23	disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for
13681	69	22	his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree
13682	67	20	breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm
13683	68	23	Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and
13684	72	21	what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he
13685	72	22	breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.
13686	0	0	
13687	59	19	If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
13688	66	21	indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
13689	71	21	certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the
13690	68	20	blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I
13691	71	22	shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
13692	65	20	Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
13693	67	20	aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
13694	68	21	fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then
13695	71	24	live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
13696	69	18	case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
13697	70	21	hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or
13698	71	22	so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has
13699	69	20	no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine
13700	61	19	he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
13701	70	21	vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are
13702	72	22	completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more,
13703	72	23	a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in
13704	70	20	him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus
13705	66	19	supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs.
13706	67	20	The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the
13707	66	25	supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more
13708	69	23	cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of
13709	67	21	that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase
13710	71	22	it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the
13711	68	23	Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform
13712	71	21	with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and
13713	71	19	jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he
13714	71	24	rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to
13715	71	22	a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that
13716	70	23	he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular
13717	70	21	allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he
13718	70	19	finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that
13719	66	23	in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one
13720	69	20	they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
13721	66	23	spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
13722	72	22	descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
13723	69	20	whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For
13724	71	20	not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing
13725	71	18	a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
13726	65	20	hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
13727	0	0	
13728	66	19	In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving
13729	70	22	for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
13730	71	21	attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
13731	66	21	Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
13732	0	0	
13733	72	22	It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
13734	71	20	it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then
13735	69	21	I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell
13736	66	20	seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all
13737	70	22	answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged
13738	64	20	with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of
13739	71	19	smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or
13740	71	24	whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on
13741	71	20	this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
13742	68	21	olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no
13743	25	9	Cologne-water in the sea.
13744	0	0	
13745	71	23	Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
13746	70	21	canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is furnished
13747	71	19	with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of
13748	71	25	air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;
13749	67	17	unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles,
13750	69	19	he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?
13751	66	19	Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
13752	70	19	this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
13753	63	16	living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
13754	0	0	
13755	66	19	Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it
13756	62	21	is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
13757	70	22	horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
13758	70	24	to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
13759	72	23	in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this
13760	71	22	gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the
13761	69	21	Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that
13762	61	19	exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and
13763	72	21	discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly
13764	71	21	communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this
13765	69	22	is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because
13766	72	23	the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he
13767	70	21	accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath
13768	68	22	the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if
13769	72	20	you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find
13770	71	23	that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods
13771	52	17	of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
13772	0	0	
13773	69	20	But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
13774	68	22	You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
13775	68	19	tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
13776	66	20	settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the
13777	72	20	knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in
13778	52	16	it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
13779	0	0	
13780	71	19	The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
13781	67	18	it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
13782	70	24	when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
13783	66	23	of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading
13784	69	21	all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really
13785	71	23	perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
13786	66	19	not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they
13787	68	23	are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
13788	70	21	fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head? For
13789	69	19	even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with
13790	70	21	his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then,
13791	69	22	the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under
13792	70	23	a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
13793	5	2	rain.
13794	0	0	
13795	71	23	Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
13796	71	23	precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
13797	71	22	into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
13798	71	21	this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
13799	68	17	slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the jet, which will
13800	68	18	often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
13801	70	20	the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer
13802	68	20	contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view,
13803	71	21	or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
13804	69	23	Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to
13805	70	23	evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt
13806	72	22	it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.
13807	72	21	The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let
13808	24	8	this deadly spout alone.
13809	0	0	
13810	68	19	Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
13811	67	18	hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides
13812	66	22	other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
13813	69	20	touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;
13814	71	23	I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
13815	67	20	fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
13816	65	22	whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am
13817	71	21	convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
13818	70	20	Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes
13819	66	22	up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep
13820	66	21	thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the
13821	72	24	curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there,
13822	67	24	a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my
13823	72	24	head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,
13824	71	21	after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon;
13825	60	22	this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.
13826	0	0	
13827	68	19	And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
13828	71	20	behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
13829	69	23	head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable
13830	72	25	contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes see it--glorified
13831	69	21	by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
13832	71	23	For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate
13833	67	17	vapour. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
13834	68	20	mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a
13835	71	18	heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
13836	67	21	but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts
13837	67	19	of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this
13838	67	24	combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
13839	33	10	regards them both with equal eye.

13846	69	23	Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
13847	72	21	and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I
13848	17	7	celebrate a tail.
13849	0	0	
13850	72	21	Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point of
13851	67	20	the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
13852	72	26	upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The
13853	71	19	compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms
13854	69	19	or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness.
13855	71	19	At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways
13856	69	23	recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In
13857	72	25	no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in
13858	70	21	the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the
13859	71	20	full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.
13860	0	0	
13861	68	21	The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
13862	68	20	into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,
13863	64	19	middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are
13864	69	19	long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
13865	71	23	crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as
13866	69	20	anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman
13867	67	20	walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
13868	68	22	course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
13869	70	22	relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
13870	30	7	great strength of the masonry.
13871	0	0	
13872	70	23	But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
13873	68	21	the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
13874	69	21	muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
13875	65	16	and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
13876	68	20	largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
13877	67	23	measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
13878	65	21	Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.
13879	0	0	
13880	72	19	Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful
13881	69	25	flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through
13882	69	22	a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most
13883	72	22	appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony,
13884	64	20	but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,
13885	71	19	strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that
13886	70	20	all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its
13887	71	22	charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
13888	72	22	naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
13889	71	22	man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God
13890	69	19	the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever
13891	64	19	they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
13892	66	23	hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
13893	70	23	successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all
13894	70	22	brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine
13895	72	22	one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form
13896	48	16	the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.

13898	67	20	Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
13899	69	22	wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
13900	72	24	be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no
13901	29	7	fairy's arm can transcend it.
13902	0	0	
13903	68	23	Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
13904	71	21	progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
13905	48	14	Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
13906	0	0	
13907	69	22	First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in
13908	70	23	a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
13909	68	19	wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
13910	67	22	whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
13911	72	17	forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this
13912	69	20	which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when
13913	57	16	furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
13914	0	0	
13915	67	20	Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
13916	70	19	fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
13917	67	19	conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In
13918	70	19	striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
13919	71	21	blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed
13920	68	19	air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
13921	64	19	irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only
13922	66	22	salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the
13923	68	19	opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale
13924	68	22	boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed
13925	65	17	plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most
13926	71	25	serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the
13927	71	20	fishery, that they are accounted mere child's play. Some one strips off
13928	33	9	a frock, and the hole is stopped.
13929	0	0	
13930	69	20	Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
13931	67	20	the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
13932	64	21	there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
13933	67	20	elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
13934	67	20	sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
13935	68	22	slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface
13936	70	23	of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,
13937	69	19	whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!
13938	70	21	Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of
13939	67	20	Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with
13940	70	22	low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their
13941	70	22	zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
13942	67	22	possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet
13943	72	20	another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk
13944	23	6	and extracted the dart.
13945	0	0	
13946	71	24	Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
13947	69	21	middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
13948	70	22	of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
13949	67	19	hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of
13950	69	21	his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
13951	72	24	thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great
13952	70	22	gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour
13953	71	20	from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was
13954	30	9	the smoke from the touch-hole.
13955	0	0	
13956	70	22	Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
13957	70	21	lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
13958	69	23	out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into
13959	70	21	the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
13960	68	21	tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
13961	68	22	downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime BREACH--somewhere
13962	71	21	else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the
13963	71	23	grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
13964	67	21	profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
13965	72	22	highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth
13966	65	18	his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in
13967	67	21	gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in
13968	68	22	the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the
13969	70	19	archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
13970	69	21	crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
13971	71	20	all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
13972	70	23	peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
13973	70	24	of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of
13974	68	22	the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African
13975	72	23	elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout
13976	68	20	of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of
13977	68	21	antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
13978	20	7	profoundest silence.
13979	0	0	
13980	64	19	The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
13981	69	21	elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
13982	62	19	of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two
13983	69	22	opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
13984	67	21	respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
13985	70	21	to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the
13986	72	19	stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as
13987	71	20	the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash
13988	71	22	of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have
13989	69	22	one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews
13990	63	18	into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*
13991	0	0	
13992	0	0	
13993	67	21	*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
13994	68	22	and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
13995	72	21	elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to
13996	72	24	the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious
13997	72	22	similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant
13998	69	19	will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it,
13999	25	7	jet it forth in a stream.

14002	72	23	The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability
14003	68	20	to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they
14004	67	20	would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an
14005	71	23	extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures,
14006	67	22	that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason
14007	59	14	signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these methods
14008	67	19	intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other
14009	66	19	motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and
14010	71	24	unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,
14011	71	19	then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know
14012	68	20	not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more,
14013	70	20	how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back
14014	69	18	parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen. But I
14015	70	20	cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will about
14016	37	13	his face, I say again he has no face.

14023	71	22	The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
14024	70	22	the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.
14025	68	21	In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
14026	64	16	Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a
14027	65	21	vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia,
14028	68	20	and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded
14029	70	22	oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
14030	72	23	for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the
14031	71	19	straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels
14032	57	18	bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.
14033	0	0	
14034	68	21	Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
14035	69	17	midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
14036	70	21	promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond
14037	64	21	to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
14038	70	21	considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,
14039	69	19	and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
14040	71	25	sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
14041	70	21	treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
14042	71	24	appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping
14043	64	19	western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied
14044	66	20	with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
14045	69	22	Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these
14046	71	26	Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from
14047	68	20	the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
14048	69	18	past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra
14049	69	21	and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while
14050	70	24	they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
14051	34	12	their claim to more solid tribute.
14052	0	0	
14053	65	21	Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among
14054	69	23	the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
14055	70	21	vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
14056	71	21	point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
14057	70	26	have received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these
14058	70	22	corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present
14059	68	21	day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in
14060	59	19	those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
14061	0	0	
14062	65	18	With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
14063	68	20	straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
14064	72	21	thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and
14065	70	19	there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and
14066	72	23	gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there.
14067	70	22	By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the
14068	71	20	known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending
14069	71	25	upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled
14070	70	20	in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the
14071	69	20	sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might most
14072	41	14	reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.
14073	0	0	
14074	72	21	But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
14075	69	18	drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now,
14076	65	18	the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs
14077	68	19	no sustenance but what's in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the
14078	65	20	whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
14079	70	20	transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
14080	71	20	no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a
14081	70	19	whole lake's contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
14082	67	23	utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She
14083	68	20	carries years' water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,
14084	68	21	when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to
14085	72	19	drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from
14086	72	22	the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may
14087	69	22	have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score
14088	68	18	of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted
14089	71	24	one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
14090	70	19	themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had
14091	59	14	come; they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!"
14092	0	0	
14093	68	19	Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
14094	70	22	Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of
14095	71	22	the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
14096	65	22	excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more
14097	66	24	and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
14098	71	22	admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the
14099	66	19	land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils
14100	67	19	the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was
14101	67	20	descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
14102	64	18	hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
14103	72	21	customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of
14104	33	12	singular magnificence saluted us.
14105	0	0	
14106	72	23	But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which
14107	69	22	of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,
14108	71	24	instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
14109	71	22	former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes
14110	63	21	embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if
14111	72	25	numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual
14112	70	23	assistance and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into
14113	71	22	such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the
14114	70	21	best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months
14115	71	21	together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly
14116	55	17	saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
14117	0	0	
14118	67	20	Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
14119	68	22	forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,
14120	69	22	a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
14121	70	21	noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
14122	72	19	Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft
14123	69	20	drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the
14124	67	18	Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
14125	35	11	rising and falling away to leeward.

14127	70	20	Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
14128	70	22	the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into the
14129	68	21	air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
14130	70	23	like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
14131	58	18	of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
14132	0	0	
14133	69	23	As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
14134	71	25	accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
14135	72	25	their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
14136	71	20	even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
14137	69	19	the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
14138	55	15	swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
14139	0	0	
14140	64	20	Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
14141	67	20	handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their
14142	71	18	yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
14143	70	19	chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy
14144	67	23	into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
14145	69	19	number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby
14146	67	18	Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
14147	67	24	white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with
14148	71	23	stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
14149	69	22	before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly
14150	45	16	directing attention to something in our wake.
14151	0	0	
14152	72	23	Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
14153	72	23	It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling something
14154	71	20	like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and
14155	72	21	go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling
14156	65	18	his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole,
14157	58	14	crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the
14158	35	9	sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!"
14159	0	0	
14160	67	20	As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
14161	72	23	fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot
14162	69	23	pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift
14163	69	19	Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very
14164	67	19	kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to
14165	71	19	her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they
14166	69	19	were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his
14167	71	20	forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the
14168	69	21	bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed
14169	69	20	his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in
14170	68	17	which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that
14171	70	21	gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that
14172	69	20	same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;
14173	61	17	and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and
14174	69	23	inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their
14175	69	19	curses;--when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's
14176	68	19	brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some
14177	68	20	stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm
14178	21	5	thing from its place.
14179	0	0	
14180	67	18	But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
14181	66	18	when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
14182	68	22	Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
14183	62	18	side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
14184	72	25	harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining
14185	71	23	upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained
14186	67	19	upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at
14187	71	21	length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them;
14188	72	18	and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But
14189	72	20	no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm
14190	71	23	Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,--though
14191	66	21	as yet a mile in their rear,--than they rallied again, and forming
14192	67	21	in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like
14193	69	21	flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
14194	0	0	
14195	67	17	Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
14196	72	24	after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase,
14197	64	23	when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
14198	68	20	token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
14199	68	22	perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive
14200	68	20	it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns
14201	71	20	in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
14202	72	24	broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus' elephants in the
14203	71	23	Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation.
14204	68	21	In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly
14205	65	15	swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they
14206	64	19	plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more
14207	69	19	strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed
14208	72	21	as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the
14209	72	24	sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over
14210	72	22	the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced
14211	69	23	such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic
14212	67	20	of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of
14213	66	22	thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a
14214	66	19	solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded
14215	63	18	together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the
14216	71	19	slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
14217	72	19	trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,
14218	65	20	therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales
14219	72	21	before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
14220	41	13	infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
14221	0	0	
14222	68	22	Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
14223	70	22	yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
14224	69	24	retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
14225	66	23	those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one
14226	71	24	lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes' time,
14227	69	19	Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
14228	72	21	in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight
14229	68	19	for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the
14230	71	21	whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and
14231	69	23	indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present
14232	70	23	one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift
14233	67	22	monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid
14234	62	22	adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.
14235	0	0	
14236	70	19	As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
14237	70	21	speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
14238	70	21	thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
14239	68	23	the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
14240	67	20	like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
14241	67	18	through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
14242	39	11	moment it may be locked in and crushed.
14243	0	0	
14244	69	23	But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
14245	71	22	from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away
14246	71	22	from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
14247	71	21	time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
14248	72	20	way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time
14249	71	24	to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted
14250	68	19	duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the
14251	70	22	shouting part of the business. "Out of the way, Commodore!" cried one,
14252	65	21	to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
14253	69	19	and for an instant threatened to swamp us. "Hard down with your tail,
14254	70	23	there!" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
14255	55	15	calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.
14256	0	0	
14257	70	24	All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
14258	66	18	by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood
14259	68	21	of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
14260	68	20	other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
14261	67	19	attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
14262	72	24	being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly
14263	67	19	among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales
14264	70	23	are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm
14265	67	22	whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must
14266	72	21	kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing
14267	69	21	them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it
14268	72	25	is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat
14269	72	19	was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully
14270	71	18	darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the
14271	72	23	enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like
14272	72	19	malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the
14273	69	21	act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one
14274	70	23	of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it
14275	69	20	away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from
14276	70	21	under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we
14277	72	19	stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for
14278	9	3	the time.
14279	0	0	
14280	67	21	It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were
14281	65	19	it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly
14282	72	20	diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the
14283	72	24	circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that
14284	72	21	when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways
14285	67	19	vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we
14286	70	22	glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if
14287	70	24	from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here
14288	72	22	the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard
14289	67	19	but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth
14290	67	22	satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture
14291	65	19	thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now
14292	65	17	in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every
14293	72	21	commotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of
14294	70	21	the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight
14295	71	21	or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of
14296	69	21	horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic
14297	71	23	circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have
14298	72	21	gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing
14299	69	23	whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no
14300	71	21	possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for
14301	69	18	a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only
14302	70	22	admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,
14303	69	21	we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women
14304	33	9	and children of this routed host.
14305	0	0	
14306	69	24	Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
14307	70	24	outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
14308	71	23	any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
14309	69	24	the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
14310	69	21	miles. At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might be
14311	63	20	deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
14312	68	21	seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
14313	67	21	circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
14314	66	19	locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the
14315	71	22	herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
14316	70	20	stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
14317	67	23	innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller
14318	70	21	whales--now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
14319	69	23	lake--evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
14320	72	23	becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household
14321	64	18	dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and
14322	65	18	touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
14323	70	23	domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched
14324	68	20	their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the
14325	31	10	time refrained from darting it.
14326	0	0	
14327	71	21	But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
14328	69	21	stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended
14329	71	20	in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
14330	64	18	whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to
14331	71	23	become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
14332	72	19	exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly
14333	66	20	and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different
14334	69	20	lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
14335	71	24	spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;--even so did the
14336	70	22	young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
14337	72	22	we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their
14338	69	24	sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little
14339	70	20	infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
14340	64	23	have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in
14341	71	19	girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet
14342	69	24	recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the
14343	67	22	maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final
14344	68	20	spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate
14345	66	17	side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the
14346	71	23	plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign
14347	6	1	parts.

14349	70	23	"Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; "him fast! him
14350	66	17	fast!--Who line him! Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one little!"
14351	0	0	
14352	36	9	"What ails ye, man?" cried Starbuck.

14356	72	20	As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
14357	71	22	fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
14358	70	20	the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
14359	68	21	air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame
14360	71	20	Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not
14361	70	22	seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with
14362	70	22	the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that
14363	68	19	the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas
14364	68	22	seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan
14365	20	7	amours in the deep.*

14367	0	0	
14368	72	22	*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike
14369	71	22	most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation
14370	69	19	which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a
14371	68	21	time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and
14372	70	20	Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously
14373	66	22	situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves
14374	66	18	extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a
14375	70	19	nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk
14376	72	21	and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet
14377	72	18	and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.
14378	68	23	When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.

14381	67	20	And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
14382	71	21	and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
14383	71	23	fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
14384	69	23	in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of
14385	72	18	my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and
14386	71	24	while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
14387	62	19	deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.

14389	66	21	Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
14390	67	21	spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
14391	68	19	still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
14392	72	20	possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of
14393	67	21	room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
14394	69	18	of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
14395	67	19	across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is
14396	69	21	sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
14397	64	18	and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
14398	71	21	maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled
14399	69	22	cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again.
14400	64	19	A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not
14401	72	22	effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along
14402	68	21	with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of
14403	71	21	the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone
14404	68	22	mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay
14405	17	5	wherever he went.
14406	0	0	
14407	72	22	But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
14408	64	20	enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to
14409	69	20	inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the
14410	70	21	intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that
14411	67	21	by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had
14412	67	22	become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
14413	70	21	away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope
14414	67	20	attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
14415	70	23	harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
14416	65	16	from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning
14417	65	19	through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and
14418	64	20	tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own
14419	9	3	comrades.
14420	0	0	
14421	63	19	This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
14422	67	19	stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
14423	68	21	began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
14424	70	18	by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to
14425	70	22	heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
14426	66	20	in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
14427	68	17	circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was
14428	67	20	departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
14429	71	23	tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in
14430	72	21	Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,
14431	70	22	as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck
14432	55	16	and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.
14433	0	0	
14434	67	20	"Oars! Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"gripe your
14435	71	16	oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
14436	68	19	you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him! Stand up--stand
14437	71	16	up, and stay so! Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their backs--scrape
14438	20	5	them!--scrape away!"
14439	0	0	
14440	71	20	The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
14441	72	22	narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor
14442	66	19	we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly,
14443	70	22	and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many
14444	69	20	similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had
14445	69	20	just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales,
14446	69	20	all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply
14447	72	20	purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who, while standing in the bows
14448	70	20	to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by
14449	71	22	the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close
14450	3	0	by.
14451	0	0	
14452	66	24	Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
14453	66	21	resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
14454	67	20	clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
14455	72	21	onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but
14456	69	20	the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales
14457	67	20	might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had
14458	69	22	killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which
14459	70	22	are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand,
14460	68	22	are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to
14461	72	23	mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should
14462	38	11	the boats of any other ship draw near.

14464	71	24	The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
14465	65	17	saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish. Of all the
14466	70	21	drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for
14467	72	22	the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other
14468	22	6	craft than the Pequod.

14475	69	22	The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
14476	71	23	Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
14477	18	6	vast aggregations.
14478	0	0	
14479	68	22	Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
14480	65	20	have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
14481	71	22	occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
14482	71	19	Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those
14483	71	23	composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young
14484	60	20	vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
14485	0	0	
14486	71	27	In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
14487	71	21	male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
14488	67	17	his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
14489	71	24	ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
14490	67	20	over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces
14491	67	20	and endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and
14492	70	22	his concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
14493	65	21	leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not
14494	66	22	more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
14495	70	25	comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
14496	71	21	yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
14497	51	18	whole they are hereditarily entitled to EMBONPOINT.

14499	69	21	It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
14500	72	24	ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely
14501	72	23	search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower
14502	69	23	of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from
14503	71	20	spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all
14504	69	21	unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and
14505	69	23	down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental
14506	71	26	waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other
14507	34	13	excessive temperature of the year.
14508	0	0	
14509	64	20	When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
14510	65	21	suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
14511	72	22	interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming
14512	68	22	that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies,
14513	70	21	with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away!
14514	66	22	High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be
14515	70	20	permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the
14516	71	24	Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed;
14517	72	23	for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the
14518	72	21	most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales,
14519	70	21	who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with
14520	71	20	their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving
14521	72	21	for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not
14522	71	23	a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,--furrowed
14523	72	20	heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and
14524	18	6	dislocated mouths.
14525	0	0	
14526	69	22	But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
14527	70	17	the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting to watch
14528	66	19	that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
14529	69	23	revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,
14530	70	24	like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
14531	68	19	Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
14532	71	21	chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish
14533	68	19	of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the
14534	69	17	sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
14535	67	19	take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For
14536	72	22	like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord
14537	71	20	Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower; and so,
14538	68	24	being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the
14539	70	22	world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardour
14540	67	21	of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as reflection lends
14541	71	24	her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated
14542	72	24	Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens; our
14543	70	23	Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life,
14544	67	17	forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old
14545	71	25	soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his
14546	66	21	prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.
14547	0	0	
14548	67	19	Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so
14549	62	16	is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
14550	72	22	schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however admirably
14551	71	22	satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then go abroad
14552	70	20	inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title,
14553	70	22	schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed
14554	68	20	upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who first
14555	71	22	thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of
14556	69	19	Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that
14557	68	20	famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and what was the nature of
14558	59	19	those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils.
14559	0	0	
14560	67	22	The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
14561	65	20	betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
14562	68	23	Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is
14563	72	26	called--proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,
14564	68	22	he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to
14565	70	20	wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
14566	32	9	she keeps so many moody secrets.
14567	0	0	
14568	67	22	The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
14569	66	19	mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while
14570	69	23	those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
14571	69	18	forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
14572	68	22	of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
14573	69	21	excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
14574	70	22	and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
14575	0	0	
14576	69	19	The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like
14577	71	20	a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
14578	69	18	tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
14579	70	24	prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
14580	68	21	lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,
14581	72	23	and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in
14582	38	10	quest of settlements, that is, harems.
14583	0	0	
14584	66	23	Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
14585	56	18	still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a
14586	68	19	Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike
14587	69	21	a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
14588	71	22	every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
14589	26	7	themselves to fall a prey.

14596	68	22	The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
14597	66	23	necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
14598	68	18	fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

14600	70	20	It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
14601	71	20	a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
14602	67	21	and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised
14603	70	22	many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For
14604	66	23	example,--after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale,
14605	70	20	the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
14606	70	21	drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
14607	66	19	calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus
14608	65	24	the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between
14609	67	21	the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
14610	39	13	undisputed law applicable to all cases.
14611	0	0	
14612	62	20	Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
14613	71	20	enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in
14614	70	19	A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
14615	67	22	law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and
14616	67	18	lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
14617	67	19	comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and the By-laws of
14618	71	22	the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People's
14619	71	21	Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne's farthing,

14626	68	19	But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
14627	66	22	brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
14628	11	4	expound it.
14629	0	0	
14630	69	19	First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
14631	72	22	when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all
14632	71	21	controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an oar, a nine-inch
14633	67	20	cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same.
14634	70	22	Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any other
14635	72	21	recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it plainly
14636	71	25	evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their
14637	19	7	intention so to do.
14638	0	0	
14639	71	25	These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
14640	65	17	themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks--the
14641	65	20	Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
14642	66	25	honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases,
14643	70	26	where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
14644	71	22	possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
14645	37	12	others are by no means so scrupulous.
14646	0	0	
14647	71	26	Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
14648	71	20	in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
14649	71	20	a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
14650	69	21	succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
14651	68	22	their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
14652	68	20	itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up
14653	67	19	with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it
14654	70	21	before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were
14655	71	20	remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs'
14656	72	21	teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done,
14657	70	23	he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained
14658	63	22	attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the
14659	71	23	plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line,
14660	19	6	harpoons, and boat.
14661	0	0	
14662	65	19	Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was
14663	66	20	the judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on
14664	62	19	to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con.
14665	68	21	case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's
14666	68	23	viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
14667	71	23	the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
14668	64	21	recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he
14669	69	19	then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
14670	72	20	harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the
14671	72	21	great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet
14672	66	22	abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore
14673	71	22	when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that
14674	71	21	subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have
14675	27	8	been found sticking in her.
14676	0	0	
14677	72	22	Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale
14678	58	19	and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
14679	0	0	
14680	70	20	These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
14681	69	20	learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the boat, he
14682	66	22	awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it
14683	68	20	to save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,
14684	71	22	harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because
14685	70	23	it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons
14686	64	18	and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)
14687	71	22	acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards
14688	69	19	took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took
14689	51	17	the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.
14690	0	0	
14691	70	22	A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
14692	65	18	possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the
14693	67	18	matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
14694	69	24	previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in
14695	71	22	the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,
14696	66	20	I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
14697	72	21	jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture,
14698	70	20	the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two
14699	18	4	props to stand on.
14700	0	0	
14701	71	22	Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the law:
14702	68	20	that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
14703	68	21	possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
14704	72	22	Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is
14705	72	21	the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last
14706	72	22	mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion
14707	71	20	with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the
14708	70	24	ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone,
14709	67	22	the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone's family from starvation;
14710	72	21	what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of
14711	68	20	Savesoul's income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese
14712	70	22	of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
14713	68	18	without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a
14714	69	19	Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns and hamlets
14715	68	20	but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor
14716	64	18	Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother
14717	68	19	Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not
14718	32	10	Possession the whole of the law?
14719	0	0	
14720	64	18	But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable,
14721	67	20	the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
14722	43	15	internationally and universally applicable.

14746	71	19	Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the

14748	71	21	that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
14749	72	22	and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,
14750	69	23	in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate
14751	68	21	remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in
14752	72	23	force in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
14753	70	23	touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of
14754	67	22	in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts

14761	69	22	It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
14762	68	21	of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
14763	70	22	beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
14764	66	21	the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the
14765	68	23	jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
14766	68	20	Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal
14767	71	24	emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment
14768	66	20	his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.
14769	66	21	Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
14770	68	21	perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
14771	5	1	them.

14773	67	20	Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
14774	72	22	trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat
14775	69	18	fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the precious
14776	72	23	oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good
14777	72	22	ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up
14778	70	20	steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with
14779	72	21	a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale's head,
14780	70	17	he says--"Hands off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it
14781	70	20	as the Lord Warden's." Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful
14782	65	17	consternation--so truly English--knowing not what to say, fall to
14783	72	22	vigorously scratching their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing
14784	71	19	from the whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter,
14785	70	20	or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy
14786	69	19	of Blackstone. At length one of them, after long scratching about for
14787	30	10	his ideas, made bold to speak,
14788	0	0	
14789	38	10	"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"
14790	0	0	
14791	11	3	"The Duke."
14792	0	0	
14793	55	14	"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"
14794	0	0	
14795	12	3	"It is his."
14796	0	0	
14797	67	22	"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is
14798	71	21	all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at all for our
14799	24	7	pains but our blisters?"
14800	0	0	
14801	12	3	"It is his."
14802	0	0	
14803	67	22	"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
14804	22	8	getting a livelihood?"
14805	0	0	
14806	12	3	"It is his."
14807	0	0	
14808	69	19	"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
14809	12	3	this whale."
14810	0	0	
14811	12	3	"It is his."
14812	0	0	
14813	53	15	"Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"
14814	0	0	
14815	12	3	"It is his."
14816	0	0	
14817	67	20	In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
14818	70	23	Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
14819	68	20	lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
14820	71	21	deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
14821	70	20	of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to
14822	71	26	take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To
14823	69	19	which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
14824	65	21	that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
14825	68	22	obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend
14826	66	20	gentleman) would decline meddling with other people's business. Is
14827	69	18	this the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three
14828	48	12	kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?
14829	0	0	
14830	66	20	It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
14831	71	24	Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs
14832	72	24	inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with
14833	72	19	that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives
14834	66	19	us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to
14835	68	22	the King and Queen, "because of its superior excellence." And by the
14836	71	22	soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
14837	8	2	matters.
14838	0	0	
14839	71	22	But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
14840	21	5	for that, ye lawyers!
14841	0	0	
14842	71	22	In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's Bench
14843	69	22	author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: "Ye tail is ye Queen's,
14844	69	21	that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone." Now this
14845	68	20	was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or
14846	67	21	Right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices. But this same bone
14847	65	20	is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for
14848	65	23	a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be
14849	60	20	presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.
14850	0	0	
14851	72	19	There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the whale
14852	68	21	and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
14853	69	18	nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue.
14854	65	18	I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by
14855	70	23	inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
14856	70	21	way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head
14857	68	18	peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
14858	67	23	humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there
14859	42	13	seems a reason in all things, even in law.

14866	72	24	"In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,
14867	60	17	insufferable fetor denying not inquiry." SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.

14870	72	22	It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we
14871	70	21	were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many
14872	68	21	noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the
14873	69	22	three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was
14874	17	5	smelt in the sea.
14875	0	0	
14876	70	22	"I will bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts are
14877	69	20	some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
14878	27	9	would keel up before long."
14879	0	0	
14880	71	22	Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
14881	72	22	lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
14882	71	21	alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from
14883	72	20	his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and
14884	70	23	hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
14885	70	19	must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that
14886	72	25	has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse.
14887	64	19	It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must
14888	70	22	exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are
14889	70	24	incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded
14890	70	23	by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.
14891	71	19	Yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that
14892	70	23	the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and
14893	43	14	by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose.
14894	0	0	
14895	71	20	Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
14896	68	23	had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more
14897	65	20	of a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of
14898	66	20	those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort
14899	69	25	of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
14900	67	20	almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the
14901	66	19	proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn
14902	69	20	up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
14903	18	6	whales in general.
14904	0	0	
14905	66	17	The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed
14906	69	22	he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
14907	46	15	knotted round the tail of one of these whales.
14908	0	0	
14909	71	18	"There's a pretty fellow, now," he banteringly laughed, standing in the
14910	70	18	ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes
14911	67	21	of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering
14912	69	19	their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,
14913	70	21	and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
14914	71	21	tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they
14915	68	20	will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's wick into; aye, we all
14916	72	20	know these things; but look ye, here's a Crappo that is content with our
14917	71	22	leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with
14918	69	20	scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor
14919	70	21	devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's make him a present
14920	68	20	of a little oil for dear charity's sake. For what oil he'll get from
14921	68	19	that drugged whale there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not
14922	71	20	in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get
14923	70	20	more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than
14924	71	18	he'll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it
14925	70	22	may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.
14926	72	18	I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It's worth trying. Yes,
14927	59	16	I'm for it;" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.
14928	0	0	
14929	70	21	By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
14930	72	21	or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of
14931	71	21	escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb
14932	68	17	now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing
14933	72	21	across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French
14934	71	22	taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
14935	65	18	huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper
14936	68	21	spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a
14937	72	21	symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in
14938	72	22	large gilt letters, he read "Bouton de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud;
14939	53	16	and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.
14940	0	0	
14941	71	20	Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription, yet
14942	69	22	the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently
14943	27	9	explained the whole to him.
14944	0	0	
14945	71	20	"A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose, "that will
14946	51	14	do very well; but how like all creation it smells!"
14947	0	0	
14948	69	22	Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
14949	72	21	had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to
14950	39	11	the blasted whale; and so talk over it.
14951	0	0	
14952	62	17	Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
14953	72	25	bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that
14954	15	4	speak English?"
14955	0	0	
14956	70	21	"Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
14957	15	5	the chief-mate.
14958	0	0	
14959	67	20	"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"
14960	0	0	
14961	13	3	"WHAT whale?"
14962	0	0	
14963	61	17	"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
14964	0	0	
14965	65	19	"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale--no."
14966	0	0	
14967	65	19	"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."
14968	0	0	
14969	69	21	Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
14970	72	23	over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands
14971	71	21	into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir! No!" Upon which Ahab retired, and
14972	32	8	Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
14973	0	0	
14974	65	19	He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
14975	70	20	chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of
14976	4	1	bag.
14977	0	0	
14978	66	17	"What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb. "Broke it?"
14979	0	0	
14980	71	20	"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!" answered
14981	67	19	the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
14982	43	12	much. "But what are you holding YOURS for?"
14983	0	0	
14984	72	21	"Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain't it?
14985	71	20	Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,
14986	16	6	Bouton-de-Rose?"
14987	0	0	
14988	68	21	"What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman,
14989	29	9	flying into a sudden passion.
14990	0	0	
14991	68	17	"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those
14992	71	23	whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do
14993	71	21	you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
14994	69	19	such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his
14995	15	5	whole carcase."
14996	0	0	
14997	71	22	"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe
14998	71	23	it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
14999	70	22	come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me; and so I'll
15000	30	8	get out of this dirty scrape."
15001	0	0	
15002	70	20	"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined Stubb,
15003	72	23	and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented
15004	71	20	itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
15005	70	20	heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow
15006	72	21	and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their
15007	65	19	noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms.
15008	67	18	Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the
15009	67	19	mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the
15010	67	22	plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
15011	68	18	nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
15012	66	20	off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
15013	36	11	constantly filled their olfactories.
15014	0	0	
15015	70	21	Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
15016	68	23	the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
15017	72	19	fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within.
15018	64	19	This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating
15019	72	22	against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain's
15020	70	22	round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could
15021	62	21	not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.
15022	0	0	
15023	70	18	Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
15024	71	19	Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
15025	66	24	expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus,
15026	68	21	who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
15027	69	20	Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man
15028	70	21	had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore
15029	62	20	held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and
15030	70	20	confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
15031	69	21	for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all
15032	70	20	dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan
15033	72	22	of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter's office, was
15034	69	19	to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as
15035	69	20	for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in
15036	25	8	him during the interview.
15037	0	0	
15038	68	21	By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a
15039	71	22	small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with
15040	72	22	large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest
15041	71	19	with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely
15042	69	22	introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the
15043	36	11	aspect of interpreting between them.
15044	0	0	
15045	41	10	"What shall I say to him first?" said he.
15046	0	0	
15047	71	18	"Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, "you
15048	71	19	may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
15049	38	11	though I don't pretend to be a judge."
15050	0	0	
15051	69	19	"He says, Monsieur," said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
15052	68	20	captain, "that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
15053	71	22	and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
15054	42	12	blasted whale they had brought alongside."
15055	0	0	
15056	64	20	Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
15057	0	0	
15058	43	11	"What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
15059	0	0	
15060	66	19	"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
15061	63	20	carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a
15062	67	17	whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a
15063	8	3	baboon."
15064	0	0	
15065	72	22	"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
15066	72	23	far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,
15067	53	18	as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."
15068	0	0	
15069	68	21	Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
15070	72	21	crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose
15071	55	15	the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.

15073	67	19	"What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
15074	5	1	them.
15075	0	0	
15076	66	16	"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in
15077	72	20	fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
15078	6	2	else."
15079	0	0	
15080	71	21	"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to
15081	4	1	us."
15082	0	0	
15083	67	21	Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
15084	72	20	(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his
15085	36	12	cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
15086	0	0	
15087	70	21	"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the interpreter.
15088	0	0	
15089	69	17	"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink
15090	56	14	with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell him I must go."
15091	0	0	
15092	72	19	"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but
15093	70	22	that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had
15094	71	19	best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
15095	31	6	it's so calm they won't drift."
15096	0	0	
15097	71	21	By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
15098	68	19	the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line in his
15099	72	20	boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
15100	67	17	whale of the two from the ship's side. While the Frenchman's boats,
15101	71	21	then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed
15102	67	22	away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most
15103	24	8	unusually long tow-line.
15104	0	0	
15105	71	19	Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
15106	72	22	hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the
15107	69	20	Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly
15108	69	23	pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of
15109	70	25	his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
15110	72	23	cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the
15111	72	22	body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was
15112	70	19	digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck
15113	66	20	against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and
15114	68	20	pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat's crew were all in high
15115	66	23	excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as
15116	13	3	gold-hunters.
15117	0	0	
15118	63	17	And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
15119	69	18	screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning
15120	72	25	to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when
15121	68	21	suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint
15122	70	20	stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without
15123	69	20	being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with
15124	52	16	another, without at all blending with it for a time.
15125	0	0	
15126	72	20	"I have it, I have it," cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in
15127	45	15	the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"
15128	0	0	
15129	66	16	Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls
15130	68	21	of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
15131	70	22	cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with
15132	72	23	your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good
15133	68	21	friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist.
15134	69	23	Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the
15135	69	21	sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for
15136	68	21	impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board,
15137	38	11	else the ship would bid them good bye.

15143	0	0	
15144	67	21	Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as
15145	69	21	an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
15146	70	22	Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
15147	69	22	subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
15148	70	24	the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
15149	72	20	to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for
15150	72	21	grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though
15151	66	22	at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland
15152	69	23	soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,
15153	67	19	amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for
15154	70	21	mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,
15155	66	16	waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in
15156	68	21	perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.
15157	69	21	The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same
15158	70	22	purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine
15159	54	15	merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
15160	0	0	
15161	72	21	Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
15162	67	22	themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick
15163	72	22	whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and
15164	69	19	by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such
15165	70	22	a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four
15166	71	18	boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as
15167	30	8	laborers do in blasting rocks.
15168	0	0	
15169	72	23	I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain
15170	72	17	hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors'
15171	69	19	trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing
15172	62	19	more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
15173	0	0	
15174	67	19	Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
15175	71	20	found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that
15176	69	23	saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;
15177	68	22	how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory. And likewise
15178	67	20	call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh
15179	69	17	the best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
15180	72	23	ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the
15181	6	1	worst.
15182	0	0	
15183	72	23	I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,
15184	66	22	owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen,
15185	67	21	and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be
15186	63	20	considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of
15187	67	20	the Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
15188	72	24	aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout
15189	72	20	a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to rebut. They
15190	69	19	hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma
15191	10	5	originate?
15192	0	0	
15193	65	21	I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
15194	71	23	Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
15195	72	22	those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as
15196	72	20	the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in
15197	70	16	small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry
15198	70	21	it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas,
15199	71	20	and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding
15200	71	23	any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,
15201	69	24	and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a
15202	72	23	savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an
15203	64	19	old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.
15204	0	0	
15205	69	20	I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
15206	70	24	likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
15207	68	19	times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
15208	71	22	latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
15209	72	19	work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,
15210	68	20	fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a
15211	71	22	place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without
15212	68	22	being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of
15213	69	18	furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full
15214	70	22	operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is
15215	72	24	quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four
15216	68	19	years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,
15217	70	21	perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the
15218	72	19	state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that
15219	67	21	living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by
15220	70	23	no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the
15221	69	21	people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by
15222	71	21	the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
15223	70	20	when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance
15224	67	22	of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the
15225	70	23	open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's flukes above water
15226	71	20	dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a
15227	70	18	warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance,
15228	71	22	considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with
15229	71	19	jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian
15230	41	14	town to do honour to Alexander the Great?

15237	70	20	It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
15238	72	22	significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew; an
15239	65	20	event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes
15240	71	20	madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
15241	58	17	prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
15242	0	0	
15243	72	22	Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some
15244	72	22	few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work
15245	70	22	the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,
15246	72	21	these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats'
15247	71	20	crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous
15248	69	20	wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It
15249	70	19	was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by
15250	69	24	abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember
15251	58	17	his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
15252	0	0	
15253	72	22	In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
15254	72	25	white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
15255	70	20	one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and
15256	72	21	torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom
15257	69	18	very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to
15258	70	22	his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with
15259	72	20	finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year's calendar
15260	71	19	should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and
15261	71	19	New Year's Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was
15262	69	19	brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous
15263	70	20	ebony, panelled in king's cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life's
15264	69	23	peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he
15265	70	21	had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
15266	71	19	brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
15267	66	20	subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by
15268	69	20	strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the
15269	70	21	natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut,
15270	66	20	he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green; and at
15271	69	23	melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon
15272	68	23	into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day,
15273	67	23	suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop
15274	66	18	will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you
15275	70	22	the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy
15276	68	17	ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural
15277	69	21	gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then
15278	72	20	the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies,
15279	71	20	looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to
15280	10	2	the story.
15281	0	0	
15282	67	20	It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman
15283	68	23	chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
15284	45	13	and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
15285	0	0	
15286	68	19	The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
15287	69	19	but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
15288	71	22	therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
15289	71	23	him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
15290	50	14	to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
15291	0	0	
15292	69	21	Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
15293	67	20	the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
15294	66	19	happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The
15295	69	23	involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
15296	70	19	hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
15297	71	22	line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as
15298	69	20	to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That
15299	68	19	instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
15300	68	20	straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks
15301	69	19	of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
15302	40	11	several turns around his chest and neck.
15303	0	0	
15304	67	19	Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He
15305	67	19	hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,
15306	69	19	he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
15307	66	22	exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?" Meantime Pip's blue, choked face
15308	71	19	plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In less than
15309	42	13	half a minute, this entire thing happened.
15310	0	0	
15311	68	17	"Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
15312	6	2	saved.
15313	0	0	
15314	67	23	So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed
15315	67	18	by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these
15316	70	23	irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,
15317	69	20	but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,
15318	69	23	unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
15319	70	20	jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest was indefinite, as the
15320	68	22	soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, STICK TO THE BOAT, is your
15321	69	21	true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM
15322	72	22	THE BOAT, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he
15323	70	26	should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving
15324	71	21	him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped
15325	72	20	all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, "Stick to the boat,
15326	67	17	Pip, or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We
15327	71	21	can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for
15328	68	20	thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and
15329	66	16	don't jump any more." Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that
15330	68	20	though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which
15331	53	18	propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
15332	0	0	
15333	69	20	But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
15334	72	21	under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time
15335	68	20	he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to
15336	70	20	run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk.
15337	72	25	Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous,
15338	69	18	blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away,
15339	70	22	all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the
15340	66	19	extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed
15341	71	22	like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly
15342	70	20	astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was
15343	69	24	winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between
15344	66	19	Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his
15345	70	19	crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though
15346	31	8	the loftiest and the brightest.
15347	0	0	
15348	65	21	Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
15349	71	23	practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
15350	69	24	lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
15351	72	18	middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how
15352	72	22	when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark how closely they
15353	46	13	hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
15354	0	0	
15355	72	22	But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he
15356	68	23	did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,
15357	72	22	and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very
15358	69	20	quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
15359	72	24	oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested
15360	63	17	by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not
15361	66	20	unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
15362	64	21	called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
15363	27	10	military navies and armies.

15365	66	20	But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
15366	68	20	spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
15367	67	18	Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
15368	67	20	upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him
15369	72	19	miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but
15370	70	21	from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at
15371	67	20	least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
15372	71	21	up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.
15373	69	21	Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
15374	68	21	the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
15375	71	22	and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the
15376	71	26	joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,
15377	67	20	God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters
15378	67	21	heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the
15379	72	21	loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man's
15380	69	21	insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man
15381	72	21	comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and
15382	70	22	frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his
15383	4	1	God.
15384	0	0	
15385	69	17	For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
15386	70	21	fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
15387	31	9	like abandonment befell myself.

15394	63	16	That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to
15395	66	22	the Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
15396	71	24	previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
15397	29	9	the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
15398	0	0	
15399	68	22	While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed
15400	71	19	in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and
15401	71	22	when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
15402	42	11	ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
15403	0	0	
15404	72	21	It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several
15405	67	21	others, I sat down before a large Constantine's bath of it, I found
15406	70	21	it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the
15407	72	24	liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid.
15408	69	20	A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was
15409	67	23	such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a
15410	68	22	softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for
15411	72	21	only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to
15412	25	9	serpentine and spiralise.
15413	0	0	
15414	69	20	As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
15415	67	20	exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
15416	72	21	indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among
15417	71	22	those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within
15418	70	18	the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their
15419	65	21	opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
15420	68	20	uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like the smell of spring
15421	66	22	violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky
15422	67	24	meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible
15423	69	18	sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
15424	72	24	the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying
15425	72	21	the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from
15426	62	19	all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.
15427	0	0	
15428	70	24	Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
15429	65	19	till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a
15430	69	20	strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly
15431	68	19	squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the
15432	66	21	gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
15433	64	21	feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually
15434	71	23	squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as
15435	72	18	much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
15436	69	21	any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;
15437	70	24	let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into
15438	71	24	each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
15439	18	4	sperm of kindness.
15440	0	0	
15441	72	21	Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by
15442	72	25	many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases
15443	71	23	man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable
15444	71	20	felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in
15445	70	20	the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the
15446	71	24	country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case
15447	70	19	eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of
15448	63	20	angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.

15450	69	21	Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
15451	64	19	akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
15452	10	1	try-works.
15453	0	0	
15454	71	21	First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
15455	70	19	part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It
15456	68	20	is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but still contains
15457	70	22	some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first
15458	70	22	cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like
15459	27	7	blocks of Berkshire marble.
15460	0	0	
15461	71	20	Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
15462	69	19	whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
15463	71	26	often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
15464	69	23	a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
15465	70	20	imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
15466	69	18	snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
15467	70	22	purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,
15468	72	23	it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole
15469	71	22	behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive
15470	65	19	a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted,
15471	65	20	supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison
15472	63	21	season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
15473	53	18	unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.
15474	0	0	
15475	70	21	There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
15476	68	20	the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
15477	64	23	adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation
15478	71	23	original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.
15479	69	20	It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the
15480	69	21	tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting.
15481	68	20	I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,
15482	11	4	coalescing.
15483	0	0	
15484	69	18	Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
15485	69	21	sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
15486	72	20	dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland
15487	68	19	or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior
15488	38	12	souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
15489	0	0	
15490	72	20	Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's vocabulary.
15491	65	20	But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman's nipper is
15492	67	18	a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of
15493	72	21	Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is
15494	66	24	about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the
15495	64	22	oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
15496	65	20	blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.
15497	0	0	
15498	72	24	But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once
15499	72	21	to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.
15500	66	22	This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
15501	71	19	blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper
15502	70	21	time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of
15503	68	18	terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull
15504	68	19	lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally
15505	69	21	go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is
15506	68	23	similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is
15507	68	21	something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a
15508	67	17	sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship
15509	71	21	pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet
15510	72	22	itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This
15511	69	22	spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan's feet are shoeless;
15512	66	19	the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from
15513	69	22	him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his
15514	69	22	assistants', would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among
15515	25	8	veteran blubber-room men.

15522	65	22	Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
15523	68	19	post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
15524	68	19	windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
15525	71	24	curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
15526	67	19	there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
15527	71	21	cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
15528	68	21	jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
15529	72	23	surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,--longer than
15530	72	23	a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black
15531	68	24	as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or,
15532	69	20	rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in
15533	71	22	the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,
15534	71	20	King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it
15535	71	20	for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th
15536	35	9	chapter of the First Book of Kings.

15538	72	22	Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted
15539	71	20	by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,
15540	72	22	and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
15541	72	23	carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle
15542	66	18	deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an
15543	68	21	African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside
15544	70	23	out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to
15545	71	20	double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging,
15546	72	21	to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it,
15547	71	19	towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes
15548	72	20	at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer
15549	69	21	now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.
15550	67	25	Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately
15551	68	22	protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.
15552	0	0	
15553	67	20	That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
15554	72	25	pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted
15555	71	24	endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into
15556	69	19	which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator's
15557	69	21	desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent
15558	72	23	on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a
15559	23	7	Pope were this mincer!*

15562	70	22	*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates
15563	69	21	to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
15564	64	19	thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
15565	70	24	boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably
15566	51	17	increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.

15573	72	25	Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished
15574	68	18	by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
15575	69	20	masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship.
15576	68	20	It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her
15577	7	1	planks.
15578	0	0	
15579	69	19	The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
15580	71	21	roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
15581	65	19	fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
15582	62	19	mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The
15583	65	20	foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
15584	67	22	secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
15585	69	18	sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased
15586	70	20	with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened
15587	66	17	hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
15588	72	22	number, and each of several barrels' capacity. When not in use, they are
15589	65	21	kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone
15590	68	17	and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the
15591	68	19	night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
15592	70	22	themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them--one
15593	63	21	man in each pot, side by side--many confidential communications
15594	67	23	are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound
15595	71	22	mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,
15596	65	18	with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first
15597	69	19	indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies
15598	70	19	gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from
15599	37	12	any point in precisely the same time.
15600	0	0	
15601	65	17	Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
15602	69	21	masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
15603	67	20	the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted
15604	67	22	with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented
15605	70	21	from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
15606	69	21	extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
15607	70	22	inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
15608	71	23	fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
15609	57	16	from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.

15611	67	19	It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were
15612	69	21	first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee
15613	13	4	the business.
15614	0	0	
15615	68	18	"All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
15616	72	18	works." This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his
15617	70	23	shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that
15618	71	20	in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a
15619	70	23	time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick
15620	66	22	ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the
15621	72	17	crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains
15622	72	24	considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.
15623	70	21	Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once
15624	67	18	ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body.
15625	66	20	Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to
15626	71	22	inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in
15627	72	24	it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such
15628	70	20	as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left
15629	59	16	wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.

15631	68	20	By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
15632	68	21	carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
15633	67	18	darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
15634	65	17	flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
15635	68	21	illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
15636	68	21	fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
15637	67	19	some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
15638	71	20	bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
15639	67	20	sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and
15640	30	9	folded them in conflagrations.
15641	0	0	
15642	72	20	The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth
15643	67	19	in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the
15644	69	20	pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers. With huge pronged
15645	71	19	poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or
15646	72	20	stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out
15647	71	20	of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen
15648	71	21	heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil,
15649	71	25	which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth
15650	68	20	of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the
15651	70	20	windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not
15652	69	23	otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their
15653	64	19	eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all
15654	71	20	begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting
15655	72	23	barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in
15656	72	23	the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other
15657	70	20	their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth;
15658	66	22	as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the
15659	71	21	flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers
15660	69	19	wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the
15661	71	21	wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and
15662	72	18	yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness
15663	66	18	of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in
15664	70	20	her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing
15665	64	19	Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning
15666	66	18	a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the
15667	56	20	material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul.
15668	0	0	
15669	71	21	So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
15670	72	21	guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,
15671	70	17	in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the
15672	69	21	ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before
15673	72	21	me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred
15674	69	24	visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable
15675	60	18	drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.
15676	0	0	
15677	70	21	But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
15678	65	18	thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
15679	72	21	horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote
15680	70	20	my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails,
15681	67	20	just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I
15682	69	19	was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically
15683	72	19	stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see
15684	71	24	no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I
15685	72	20	had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.
15686	70	20	Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by
15687	70	19	flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift,
15688	68	21	rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as
15689	66	19	rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of
15690	71	19	death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with
15691	70	20	the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,
15692	72	18	inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief
15693	72	18	sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's stern, with
15694	69	17	my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just
15695	68	18	in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very
15696	70	19	probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this
15697	72	23	unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being
15698	19	5	brought by the lee!
15699	0	0	
15700	70	21	Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
15701	68	15	hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first
15702	70	22	hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
15703	69	18	redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,
15704	69	19	the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking
15705	70	19	flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the
15706	69	19	glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp--all others but liars!
15707	0	0	
15708	66	19	Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's
15709	68	22	accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
15710	68	21	deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,
15711	69	17	which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
15712	70	20	earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
15713	70	21	in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or undeveloped. With
15714	69	19	books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the
15715	71	23	truest of all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
15716	71	18	steel of woe. "All is vanity." ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold
15717	68	20	of unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and
15718	67	17	jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of
15719	72	22	operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all
15720	70	24	of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as
15721	65	18	passing wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit
15722	69	19	down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
15723	17	6	wondrous Solomon.
15724	0	0	
15725	65	19	But even Solomon, he says, "the man that wandereth out of the way
15726	64	19	of understanding shall remain" (I.E., even while living) "in the
15727	70	20	congregation of the dead." Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it
15728	70	23	invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom
15729	72	22	that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill
15730	70	23	eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges,
15731	68	23	and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.
15732	68	21	And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the
15733	71	24	mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still
15734	62	18	higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.

15741	61	17	Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's
15742	66	20	forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
15743	62	21	moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
15744	69	22	illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay
15745	70	25	in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
15746	45	14	score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.

15748	66	20	In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
15749	65	18	queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
15750	70	20	darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he
15751	68	19	seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an
15752	71	18	Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night
15753	51	15	the ship's black hull still houses an illumination.
15754	0	0	
15755	62	20	See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
15756	71	20	lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler at
15757	70	19	the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He
15758	69	22	burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
15759	60	20	unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
15760	67	21	contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
15761	65	19	goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and
15762	66	22	genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
15763	15	5	supper of game.

15769	0	0	
15770	63	22	Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
15771	72	21	descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and
15772	70	22	slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside
15773	70	21	and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of
15774	70	20	old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded
15775	69	24	surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he
15776	72	20	is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his
15777	70	21	spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;--but now it
15778	71	20	remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by
15779	71	22	rehearsing--singing, if I may--the romantic proceeding of decanting off
15780	66	18	his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where
15781	70	25	once again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along
15782	70	23	beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.
15783	0	0	
15784	63	19	While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
15785	70	17	six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
15786	68	20	this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
15787	66	22	round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
15788	64	16	across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
15789	69	20	man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,
15790	67	19	rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX OFFICIO,
15791	25	10	every sailor is a cooper.
15792	0	0	
15793	72	18	At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great
15794	72	21	hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down
15795	71	21	go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are
15796	59	18	replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
15797	0	0	
15798	64	18	In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
15799	72	20	incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with
15800	72	23	freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of
15801	69	22	the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as
15802	68	18	in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the
15803	70	23	bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire
15804	65	19	ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is
15805	10	4	deafening.
15806	0	0	
15807	71	24	But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
15808	70	18	self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,
15809	68	21	you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
15810	72	23	most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses
15811	69	20	a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never
15812	69	22	look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides,
15813	65	18	from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is
15814	70	22	readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale
15815	69	20	remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands
15816	68	18	go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags
15817	71	21	restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower
15818	72	25	rigging. All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise
15819	72	20	faithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed
15820	68	18	upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of
15821	71	21	sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined
15822	66	20	and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's company, the
15823	68	20	whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew
15824	71	21	themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to
15825	70	22	toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as
15826	54	18	bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.
15827	0	0	
15828	67	17	Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
15829	67	20	humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
15830	71	19	propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not
15831	70	22	to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to
15832	69	20	such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
15833	71	21	of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and
15834	17	4	bring us napkins!
15835	0	0	
15836	70	19	But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent
15837	66	19	on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again
15838	69	23	soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
15839	62	18	somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest
15840	70	19	uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through
15841	71	20	for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their
15842	70	17	wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only step to the deck to
15843	72	19	carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea,
15844	72	21	and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined
15845	70	23	fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the
15846	71	21	heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the
15847	69	21	ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor
15848	72	18	fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by
15849	71	17	the cry of "There she blows!" and away they fly to fight another whale,
15850	68	18	and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this
15851	68	17	is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long
15852	69	18	toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable
15853	65	19	sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its
15854	71	24	defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul;
15855	69	17	hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost is spouted up,
15856	71	21	and away we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life's
15857	18	8	old routine again.

15861	71	24	thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am, taught
15862	47	15	thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!

15869	71	23	Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
15870	68	21	taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but
15871	71	23	in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
15872	71	20	added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
15873	68	19	he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
15874	66	22	eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the
15875	72	22	binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass,
15876	65	20	that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his
15877	72	24	purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast,
15878	68	22	then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
15879	68	20	there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed
15880	48	14	with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.
15881	0	0	
15882	68	21	But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
15883	67	19	attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
15884	67	19	though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
15885	70	23	some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
15886	68	20	certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
15887	72	17	worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by
15888	70	21	the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in
15889	14	3	the Milky Way.
15890	0	0	
15891	72	23	Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
15892	70	20	heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
15893	70	21	head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all
15894	68	19	the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,
15895	72	25	untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito
15896	70	19	glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed
15897	70	16	by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
15898	69	19	darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
15899	68	21	sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was
15900	68	22	set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton
15901	71	23	in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white
15902	69	20	whale's talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by
15903	70	20	night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever
15904	17	5	live to spend it.

15906	70	24	Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun
15907	72	21	and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun's disks
15908	70	17	and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in
15909	70	23	luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to
15910	70	22	derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through
15911	39	10	those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
15912	0	0	
15913	72	23	It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
15914	71	21	of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL
15915	70	22	ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
15916	71	22	middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;
15917	68	20	and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that
15918	69	21	knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three
15919	68	21	Andes' summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a
15920	69	21	crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned
15921	66	20	zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the
15922	53	19	keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.

15924	68	23	Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now

15927	68	22	"There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and

15929	69	20	Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
15930	71	25	courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
15931	68	22	are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
15932	65	19	which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man in turn but
15933	72	20	mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those
15934	69	18	who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now
15935	68	21	this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign
15936	69	22	of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a
15937	69	20	former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in
15938	71	20	throes, 't is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be
15939	65	17	it, then! Here's stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then."

15941	67	17	"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must
15942	67	20	have left their mouldings there since yesterday," murmured Starbuck
15943	68	20	to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. "The old man seems to read
15944	70	20	Belshazzar's awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.
15945	63	19	He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
15946	65	21	heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint
15947	70	19	earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over
15948	67	22	all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a
15949	68	20	hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
15950	72	19	but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer.
15951	72	21	Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain
15952	69	21	snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin
15953	68	16	speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it,
15954	29	7	lest Truth shake me falsely."

15956	71	17	"There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, "he's
15957	70	19	been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
15958	69	20	faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
15959	67	21	And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on
15960	65	20	Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it very long ere
15961	71	21	spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as
15962	71	26	queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
15963	67	24	of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your
15964	68	23	doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold
15965	70	22	moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What
15966	71	23	then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing
15967	69	20	wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here's signs and
15968	71	18	wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the
15969	71	20	zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I'll get the almanac and
15970	71	21	as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try
15971	67	24	my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with
15972	69	19	the Massachusetts calendar. Here's the book. Let's see now. Signs and
15973	69	17	wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em. Hem, hem, hem; here they
15974	69	22	are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull
15975	65	18	and Jimimi! here's Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he
15976	72	20	wheels among 'em. Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the threshold
15977	71	23	between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;
15978	70	21	the fact is, you books must know your places. You'll do to give us the
15979	70	16	bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That's my
15980	70	20	small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch's
15981	69	19	navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if
15982	72	20	there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There's
15983	71	23	a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist--hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you,
15984	67	24	Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter;
15985	70	21	and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To
15986	68	20	begin: there's Aries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; then,
15987	69	18	Taurus, or the Bull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the
15988	71	20	Twins--that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes
15989	69	19	Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo,
15990	71	23	a roaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce bites and surly
15991	68	19	dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our
15992	66	17	first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
15993	71	21	Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
15994	71	20	are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the
15995	68	19	Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang
15996	65	21	come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing
15997	60	16	himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here's the
15998	69	19	battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,
15999	69	24	and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours
16000	70	20	out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the
16001	68	19	Fishes, we sleep. There's a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the
16002	69	23	sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and
16003	69	20	hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and
16004	69	20	so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly's the word for aye! Adieu,
16005	64	19	Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the
16006	66	15	try-works, now, and let's hear what he'll have to say. There; he's
16007	71	19	before it; he'll out with something presently. So, so; he's beginning."

16011	68	20	staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that's true; and at
16012	72	18	two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won't smoke
16013	70	20	dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here's nine hundred and

16018	70	22	of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman--the old
16019	72	24	hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He
16020	70	24	luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side
16021	72	20	of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he's

16027	70	19	their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch
16028	69	19	in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe
16029	62	16	sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what's the
16030	65	20	horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the roaring and
16031	69	19	devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee."

16035	68	20	tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
16036	68	21	Cannibal? As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
16037	67	17	thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
16038	71	20	suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back country.
16039	71	20	And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh--I
16040	69	20	guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don't know what to make
16041	72	21	of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers.
16042	72	25	But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out

16097	0	0	
16098	72	24	So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
16099	71	18	down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
16100	68	22	hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
16101	67	19	captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow. He was
16102	67	19	a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or
16103	69	24	thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
16104	71	21	festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
16105	56	18	behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar's surcoat.
16106	0	0	
16107	28	8	"Hast seen the White Whale!"
16108	0	0	
16109	69	18	"See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
16110	72	24	he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head
16111	14	5	like a mallet.
16112	0	0	
16113	71	23	"Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
16114	25	5	him--"Stand by to lower!"
16115	0	0	
16116	68	20	In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
16117	72	22	crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger.
16118	72	24	But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the
16119	70	20	moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
16120	71	21	once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
16121	72	24	always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
16122	65	19	the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other
16123	60	17	vessel at a moment's warning. Now, it is no very easy matter
16124	64	20	for anybody--except those who are almost hourly used to it, like
16125	70	22	whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea; for
16126	68	17	the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and
16127	70	20	then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived
16128	70	23	of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied
16129	71	21	with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a
16130	71	22	clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height
16131	31	10	he could hardly hope to attain.
16132	0	0	
16133	62	19	It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
16134	66	16	circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
16135	69	23	luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
16136	68	18	in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
16137	63	18	two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
16138	71	22	perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
16139	71	21	pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
16140	70	21	to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
16141	68	21	use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
16142	69	23	because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
16143	69	21	cried out, "I see, I see!--avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing
16144	25	7	over the cutting-tackle."
16145	0	0	
16146	71	23	As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
16147	72	22	previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
16148	68	17	blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This
16149	71	21	was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
16150	69	21	solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the
16151	72	20	fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the
16152	70	20	word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his
16153	70	19	own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of
16154	69	19	the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and
16155	70	17	gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust
16156	71	22	forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his
16157	66	17	ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades)
16158	66	21	cried out in his walrus way, "Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones
16159	64	16	together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm that never can shrink, d'ye
16160	66	20	see; and a leg that never can run. Where did'st thou see the White
16161	22	6	Whale?--how long ago?"
16162	0	0	
16163	70	20	"The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
16164	65	21	the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
16165	55	17	telescope; "there I saw him, on the Line, last season."
16166	0	0	
16167	69	18	"And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding down from
16168	68	18	the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.
16169	0	0	
16170	59	18	"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"
16171	0	0	
16172	44	11	"Spin me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"
16173	0	0	
16174	67	20	"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,"
16175	70	21	began the Englishman. "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
16176	70	22	Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
16177	70	22	fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
16178	71	17	milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could only trim dish,
16179	71	20	by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
16180	69	21	from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white
16181	45	11	head and hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles."
16182	0	0	
16183	70	20	"It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
16184	7	2	breath.

16189	0	0	
16190	69	19	"Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-humoredly. "Well,
16191	72	20	this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam
16192	61	18	into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
16193	0	0	
16194	68	19	"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I
16195	10	2	know him."
16196	0	0	
16197	72	21	"How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander, "I do not know;
16198	71	22	but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;
16199	68	17	but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the
16200	72	22	line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale's;
16201	69	18	that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and
16202	68	20	what a noble great whale it was--the noblest and biggest I ever saw,
16203	69	22	sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage
16204	72	23	he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or
16205	70	21	the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's
16206	66	20	crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped
16207	59	14	into my first mate's boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way,
16208	69	21	Captain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped
16209	62	19	into Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale
16210	62	15	with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
16211	69	20	great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls
16212	67	18	alive, man--the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both
16213	71	23	eyes out--all befogged and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail
16214	70	24	looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
16215	72	20	steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with
16216	68	18	a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the
16217	66	22	second iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima
16218	67	18	tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
16219	71	18	flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
16220	72	22	all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized
16221	71	19	hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that
16222	69	21	like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same
16223	66	18	instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a
16224	67	19	flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
16225	66	17	caught me here" (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); "yes,
16226	68	19	caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell's flames, I was
16227	72	17	thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript
16228	69	18	its way along the flesh--clear along the whole length of my arm--came
16229	72	19	out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;--and that gentleman there will tell
16230	70	17	you the rest (by the way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger,
16231	68	16	my lad,--the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn."
16232	0	0	
16233	72	24	The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
16234	69	21	time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
16235	70	21	gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober
16236	71	21	one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
16237	64	20	trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
16238	67	19	marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
16239	68	21	occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
16240	70	22	crippled captains. But, at his superior's introduction of him to Ahab,
16241	71	20	he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.
16242	0	0	
16243	71	19	"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking my
16244	51	17	advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy--"
16245	0	0	
16246	66	20	"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed
16247	39	11	captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."
16248	0	0	
16249	72	20	"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot
16250	71	23	weather there on the Line. But it was no use--I did all I could; sat up
16251	66	17	with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet--"
16252	0	0	
16253	72	20	"Oh, very severe!" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering
16254	65	18	his voice, "Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he
16255	69	20	couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas
16256	70	20	over, about three o'clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with
16257	72	21	me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very
16258	68	20	dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why
16259	69	23	don't ye? You know you're a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead,
16260	67	18	boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man."
16261	0	0	
16262	71	22	"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir"--said the
16263	71	20	imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--"is apt to
16264	71	20	be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But
16265	72	17	I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that I myself--that
16266	70	19	is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy--am a strict total
16267	32	9	abstinence man; I never drink--"
16268	0	0	
16269	71	19	"Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits to
16270	71	19	him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on--go on with
16271	15	3	the arm story."
16272	0	0	
16273	71	21	"Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly. "I was about observing,
16274	69	24	sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that spite of my
16275	72	21	best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the
16276	69	20	truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more
16277	72	23	than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line.
16278	69	18	In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came.
16279	65	17	But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
16280	69	20	against all rule"--pointing at it with the marlingspike--"that is the
16281	69	21	captain's work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had
16282	65	18	that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one's brains
16283	68	25	out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical
16284	68	20	passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir"--removing his hat, and
16285	70	21	brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
16286	67	18	but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
16287	68	20	having been a wound--"Well, the captain there will tell you how that
16288	21	6	came here; he knows."
16289	0	0	
16290	70	18	"No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did; he was born with
16291	70	24	it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such another
16292	69	22	Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
16293	69	23	pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal."
16294	0	0	
16295	71	21	"What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
16296	65	18	impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
16297	0	0	
16298	68	20	"Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes! Well; after he sounded,
16299	69	23	we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
16300	72	17	didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till
16301	71	22	some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby
16302	51	13	Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he."
16303	0	0	
16304	35	10	"Did'st thou cross his wake again?"
16305	0	0	
16306	8	2	"Twice."
16307	0	0	
16308	23	6	"But could not fasten?"
16309	0	0	
16310	71	20	"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough? What should I do without
16311	69	18	this other arm? And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so much as he
16312	10	2	swallows."
16313	0	0	
16314	69	19	"Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for bait to
16315	71	19	get the right. Do you know, gentlemen"--very gravely and mathematically
16316	71	22	bowing to each Captain in succession--"Do you know, gentlemen, that the
16317	70	22	digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
16318	68	22	Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
16319	68	20	even a man's arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the
16320	64	19	White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means
16321	66	16	to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But
16322	72	23	sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine
16323	72	23	in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let
16324	72	23	one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
16325	71	22	or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks,
16326	70	19	d'ye see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully
16327	70	23	incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if
16328	70	25	you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the
16329	71	22	sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that
16330	68	22	case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you
16331	21	3	shortly, that's all."
16332	0	0	
16333	70	19	"No, thank ye, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome to the
16334	71	17	arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but not to
16335	72	24	another one. No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for him once, and
16336	72	21	that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know
16337	70	20	that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,
16338	67	18	he's best let alone; don't you think so, Captain?"--glancing at the
16339	10	3	ivory leg.
16340	0	0	
16341	67	16	"He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let
16342	71	21	alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He's all a
16343	64	16	magnet! How long since thou saw'st him last? Which way heading?"
16344	0	0	
16345	69	18	"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's," cried Bunger, stoopingly
16346	67	17	walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; "this man's
16347	68	19	blood--bring the thermometer!--it's at the boiling point!--his pulse
16348	69	18	makes these planks beat!--sir!"--taking a lancet from his pocket, and
16349	27	8	drawing near to Ahab's arm.
16350	0	0	
16351	70	20	"Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--"Man the boat!
16352	19	5	Which way heading?"
16353	0	0	
16354	68	20	"Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
16355	66	19	"What's the matter? He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain
16356	28	7	crazy?" whispering Fedallah.
16357	0	0	
16358	68	19	But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
16359	67	20	take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
16360	63	16	towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.
16361	0	0	
16362	68	19	In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men
16363	69	22	were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.
16364	69	18	With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
16365	48	16	Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.

16372	64	17	Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that
16373	68	21	she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
16374	66	21	merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
16375	70	21	Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes not
16376	71	23	far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point
16377	63	21	of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our
16378	65	19	Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
16379	67	18	fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted
16380	71	19	out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;
16381	69	23	though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant
16382	68	20	Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets
16383	69	20	pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not
16384	69	21	elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were
16385	71	21	the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm
16386	67	19	Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the
16387	33	11	whole globe who so harpooned him.
16388	0	0	
16389	69	21	In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
16390	68	21	and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
16391	70	21	Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
16392	68	21	sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
16393	72	19	and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the
16394	72	23	Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English and American,
16395	70	19	and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open.
16396	66	23	But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again
16397	70	19	bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons--how many, their mother only
16398	72	22	knows--and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their
16399	68	20	expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war
16400	70	23	Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded
16401	70	21	by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and
16402	67	20	did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In
16403	71	22	1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to
16404	69	21	go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship--well
16405	69	21	called the "Syren"--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus
16406	68	20	that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.
16407	68	21	The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
16408	12	4	Nantucketer.
16409	0	0	
16410	71	24	All honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
16411	72	23	the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have
16412	61	18	slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.

16414	68	19	The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast
16415	66	21	sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
16416	67	21	somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
16417	69	20	forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps--every
16418	69	20	soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine
16419	69	18	gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
16420	70	21	ivory heel--it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that
16421	71	20	ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
16422	69	18	lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
16423	71	20	at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it's
16424	70	20	squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were
16425	71	22	called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
16426	67	20	other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
16427	65	19	jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the
16428	71	20	howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts
16429	72	18	did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we
16430	70	19	had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down
16431	68	20	the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
16432	6	2	taste.
16433	0	0	
16434	63	18	The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it. They said it was
16435	69	19	bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
16436	70	18	certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
16437	72	21	symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you
16438	70	22	could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed.
16439	66	23	If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out
16440	67	19	of you like billiard-balls. The bread--but that couldn't be helped;
16441	68	21	besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the
16442	71	18	only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it
16443	70	22	was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all
16444	72	20	in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the
16445	71	21	cook's boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft,
16446	68	19	I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty;
16447	71	19	fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to
16448	9	2	hat-band.

16450	65	17	But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
16451	71	21	English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous, hospitable
16452	70	18	ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
16453	68	21	joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing?
16454	66	21	I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers
16455	68	22	is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of
16456	53	18	historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.
16457	0	0	
16458	65	18	The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
16459	69	18	Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
16460	61	17	in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,
16461	70	19	touching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English
16462	72	17	merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in
16463	72	20	the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural,
16464	69	23	but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special
16465	72	23	origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.

16467	69	23	During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
16468	64	16	ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I
16469	69	21	knew must be about whalers. The title was, "Dan Coopman," wherefore I
16470	68	22	concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
16471	71	21	cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was
16472	70	24	reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
16473	67	16	"Fitz Swackhammer." But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,
16474	72	21	professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and
16475	71	18	St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box
16476	71	20	of sperm candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he
16477	72	22	spied the book, assured me that "Dan Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper,"
16478	69	18	but "The Merchant." In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book
16479	72	22	treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained
16480	71	21	a very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it
16481	72	21	was, headed, "Smeer," or "Fat," that I found a long detailed list of the
16482	71	19	outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from
16483	70	17	which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
16484	0	0	
16485	71	9	400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
16486	71	11	fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins
16487	65	13	of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
16488	71	19	(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
16489	5	2	beer.
16490	0	0	
16491	68	19	Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
16492	72	23	the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,
16493	54	15	barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
16494	0	0	
16495	66	22	At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
16496	68	19	this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
16497	70	22	incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
16498	68	21	application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my
16499	68	18	own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by
16500	68	21	every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen
16501	70	20	whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and
16502	68	23	Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their
16503	69	23	naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the
16504	69	24	nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
16505	72	23	in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country
16506	70	24	where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.
16507	0	0	
16508	71	19	The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
16509	68	21	polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
16510	65	21	climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
16511	72	20	including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much
16512	69	20	exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet
16513	69	19	of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say,
16514	66	20	we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks'
16515	70	22	allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.
16516	68	21	Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
16517	66	18	fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in
16518	66	21	a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
16519	68	20	somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But
16520	70	20	this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with
16521	71	25	the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would
16522	70	23	be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
16523	65	20	boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
16524	0	0	
16525	68	20	But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers
16526	68	21	of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
16527	71	20	whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
16528	67	20	cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
16529	66	20	world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the
16530	9	3	decanter.

16537	70	21	Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
16538	71	23	dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
16539	71	25	upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
16540	71	23	sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
16541	70	19	further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,
16542	71	22	and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
16543	66	21	bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his
16544	23	9	unconditional skeleton.
16545	0	0	
16546	64	20	But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
16547	66	20	fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
16548	69	23	whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
16549	69	20	on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a
16550	67	21	specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land
16551	67	23	a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a
16552	66	22	roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,
16553	68	26	Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
16554	68	21	the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,
16555	69	20	ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of
16556	69	22	leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and
16557	25	9	cheeseries in his bowels.

16559	66	20	I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
16560	70	22	beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed
16561	69	23	with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
16562	71	20	to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
16563	71	20	poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
16564	69	20	heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my
16565	70	21	boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
16566	27	7	contents of that young cub?
16567	0	0	
16568	68	21	And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
16569	71	21	gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted
16570	71	23	to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.
16571	70	21	For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey
16572	71	23	of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with
16573	69	23	the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side
16574	71	20	glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
16575	8	3	capital.
16576	0	0	
16577	70	23	Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
16578	65	20	with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
16579	66	23	together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
16580	63	20	people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
16581	65	19	chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes;
16582	61	19	and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
16583	67	20	wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.
16584	0	0	
16585	65	19	Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
16586	70	21	unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
16587	67	24	head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
16588	71	19	seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of
16589	69	19	its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
16590	72	21	then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a
16591	46	11	grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
16592	0	0	
16593	64	19	The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with
16594	70	20	Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
16595	65	21	kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head
16596	70	21	again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a bough, the
16597	69	23	terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung
16598	34	9	sword that so affrighted Damocles.
16599	0	0	
16600	64	19	It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy
16601	69	19	Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
16602	72	26	industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous carpet
16603	69	20	on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and
16604	67	19	the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden
16605	70	16	branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying
16606	66	21	air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the
16607	67	23	leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied
16608	68	22	verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--whither
16609	72	22	flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless
16610	66	17	toilings? Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but one single word with
16611	72	20	thee! Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float from forth the loom; the
16612	71	22	freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves;
16613	70	22	and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and
16614	69	21	by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only
16615	70	22	when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through
16616	70	22	it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that
16617	69	22	are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly
16618	68	19	heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby
16619	71	23	have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in
16620	69	16	all this din of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be
16621	15	6	overheard afar.
16622	0	0	
16623	68	22	Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
16624	70	21	great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler! Yet,
16625	68	22	as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
16626	66	19	him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven
16627	71	21	over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but
16628	69	21	himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim
16629	65	20	god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
16630	0	0	
16631	71	21	Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
16632	70	22	skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
16633	67	20	jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as
16634	69	21	an object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests
16635	66	20	should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
16636	64	20	before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through the
16637	69	22	ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid
16638	69	20	its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was
16639	71	23	out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered.
16640	57	16	I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.
16641	0	0	
16642	72	24	Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.
16643	71	20	From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the
16644	72	22	altitude of the final rib, "How now!" they shouted; "Dar'st thou measure
16645	70	18	this our god! That's for us." "Aye, priests--well, how long do ye make
16646	69	21	him, then?" But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning
16647	61	17	feet and inches; they cracked each other's sconces with their
16648	69	18	yard-sticks--the great skull echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I
16649	40	12	quickly concluded my own admeasurements.
16650	0	0	
16651	67	23	These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be
16652	69	21	it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
16653	68	29	measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can
16654	71	22	refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell
16655	69	18	me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
16656	72	23	they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I
16657	72	22	have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have
16658	70	20	what the proprietors call "the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or
16659	69	23	River Whale in the United States." Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire,
16660	71	20	England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has
16661	70	23	in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size,
16662	68	18	by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.
16663	0	0	
16664	63	17	In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
16665	67	23	belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
16666	63	20	grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
16667	67	21	Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir
16668	65	21	Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a
16669	66	18	great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
16670	68	21	cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day
16671	71	22	upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
16672	71	21	shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
16673	72	20	keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at
16674	72	22	the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo
16675	69	22	in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view
16676	18	6	from his forehead.

16678	66	22	The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
16679	68	18	verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
16680	70	22	wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
16681	68	20	such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished
16682	66	20	the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was
16683	71	21	then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might remain--I did not
16684	69	19	trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
16685	50	19	enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.

16692	64	21	In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
16693	72	22	statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we
16694	63	21	are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
16695	0	0	
16696	71	24	According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
16697	65	19	upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the largest
16698	70	20	sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
16699	67	22	calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
16700	68	18	eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
16701	67	21	feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
16702	63	18	ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
16703	71	27	considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
16704	33	11	thousand one hundred inhabitants.
16705	0	0	
16706	72	20	Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
16707	66	22	leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?
16708	0	0	
16709	68	23	Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
16710	69	19	jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
16711	68	20	simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
16712	68	20	unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large
16713	70	22	a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
16714	72	22	most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in
16715	71	21	this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your
16716	72	25	arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the
16717	39	15	general structure we are about to view.
16718	0	0	
16719	69	20	In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
16720	68	20	Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
16721	69	23	been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
16722	72	18	fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet,
16723	72	21	his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of
16724	70	20	plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a
16725	70	17	third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once
16726	20	6	enclosed his vitals.
16727	0	0	
16728	68	19	To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
16729	69	21	extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
16730	72	19	the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty
16731	70	22	of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the
16732	38	11	time, but a long, disconnected timber.
16733	0	0	
16734	63	17	The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,
16735	65	18	was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
16736	69	21	successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
16737	67	20	of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From
16738	70	18	that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
16739	70	21	spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore
16740	70	20	a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most
16741	71	24	arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
16742	36	10	footpath bridges over small streams.
16743	0	0	
16744	66	19	In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
16745	70	23	circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
16746	71	20	the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of
16747	72	22	the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish
16748	68	18	which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the
16749	70	23	invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
16750	72	23	feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
16751	67	20	feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the
16752	69	21	living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw
16753	68	20	but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of
16754	67	17	added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the
16755	71	22	ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the
16756	58	16	weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
16757	0	0	
16758	71	20	How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try
16759	72	21	to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
16760	69	22	attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the
16761	68	18	heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry
16762	72	22	flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale
16763	32	9	be truly and livingly found out.
16764	0	0	
16765	67	18	But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
16766	70	21	crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
16767	46	13	it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.
16768	0	0	
16769	67	21	There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are
16770	69	19	not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on
16771	68	20	a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest,
16772	70	20	a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
16773	66	20	more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
16774	67	20	tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
16775	70	19	billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
16776	69	18	had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest's children,
16777	66	17	who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the
16778	72	21	spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple
16779	13	2	child's play.

16786	69	20	From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
16787	70	24	to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
16788	69	20	compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
16789	65	21	folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail,
16790	69	21	and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic
16791	63	22	involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great
16792	66	22	cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
16793	20	6	line-of-battle-ship.

16795	67	24	Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me
16796	64	21	to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
16797	69	21	overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
16798	69	22	out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him
16799	66	24	in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it
16800	67	24	now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and
16801	66	24	antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
16802	72	20	Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be deemed
16803	72	22	unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is
16804	66	22	altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
16805	71	22	words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been
16806	70	25	convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have
16807	69	24	invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased
16808	71	24	for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer's uncommon personal
16809	70	24	bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
16810	8	3	like me.

16812	66	19	One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
16813	67	19	though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing
16814	68	20	of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
16815	67	22	capitals. Give me a condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater for an
16816	66	15	inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my
16817	71	21	thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
16818	66	23	outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
16819	71	21	circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
16820	71	20	mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas
16821	72	24	of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its
16822	70	21	suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal
16823	71	22	theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose
16824	71	22	a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the
16825	45	14	flea, though many there be who have tried it.

16827	72	22	Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials
16828	68	23	as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been
16829	68	20	a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,
16830	68	18	wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of
16831	69	24	preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier
16832	68	22	geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
16833	71	22	completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
16834	71	23	the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted
16835	66	22	links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote
16836	65	21	posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales
16837	68	21	hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last
16838	61	20	preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them
16839	71	21	precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
16840	70	21	sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking
16841	25	8	rank as Cetacean fossils.

16843	71	22	Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
16844	72	22	and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been
16845	69	19	found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in
16846	67	23	Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
16847	71	22	Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
16848	70	22	year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street
16849	67	23	opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones
16850	67	21	disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's
16851	72	24	time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly
16852	28	10	unknown Leviathanic species.
16853	0	0	
16854	67	19	But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
16855	72	20	complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on
16856	70	24	the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous
16857	65	21	slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen
16858	68	23	angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed
16859	69	25	upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being
16860	66	22	taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out
16861	70	23	that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A
16862	70	25	significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this
16863	69	21	book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the
16864	66	19	shape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster
16865	70	25	Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the London Geological Society,
16866	68	23	pronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures
16867	63	21	which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence.

16869	67	17	When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
16870	71	21	jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances to
16871	68	22	the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on
16872	66	24	the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
16873	68	22	Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back
16874	67	23	to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;
16875	70	20	for time began with man. Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and I
16876	72	23	obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged
16877	66	20	bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in
16878	70	19	all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference, not an inhabitable
16879	64	16	hand's breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the
16880	72	21	whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines
16881	71	23	of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan?
16882	72	22	Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh's. Methuselah seems
16883	71	20	a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I am horror-struck
16884	69	25	at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of
16885	69	21	the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist after
16886	25	10	all humane ages are over.

16888	67	22	But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
16889	69	24	stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
16890	71	23	ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
16891	68	22	for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
16892	66	19	print of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah,
16893	69	24	some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
16894	72	22	sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and
16895	72	24	dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the
16896	69	20	moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there
16897	67	21	swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.
16898	0	0	
16899	70	24	Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
16900	70	22	of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
16901	50	15	the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.

16903	69	20	"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
16904	68	23	of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
16905	72	24	oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that
16906	71	20	by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can pass it
16907	71	23	without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either
16908	70	22	side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea,
16909	70	19	and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em. They keep a Whale's Rib
16910	71	20	of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with
16911	69	19	its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be
16912	70	20	reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said
16913	68	23	to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians
16914	72	19	affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy'd of Mahomet, came from this Temple,
16915	70	18	and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth
16916	40	11	by the Whale at the Base of the Temple."

16926	69	21	Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
16927	69	22	the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
16928	70	23	in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the
16929	27	9	original bulk of his sires.
16930	0	0	
16931	67	21	But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
16932	67	24	present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
16933	68	22	found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
16934	69	19	prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
16935	70	25	belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
16936	5	2	ones.
16937	0	0	
16938	68	20	Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
16939	65	20	Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
16940	70	22	seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
16941	72	24	that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large
16942	67	21	sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen's authority, that
16943	71	23	Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of
16944	8	3	capture.
16945	0	0	
16946	67	20	But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
16947	71	27	advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may
16948	56	18	it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?
16949	0	0	
16950	72	22	Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
16951	68	19	gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny
16952	70	20	tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus
16953	69	20	of others which measured eight hundred feet in length--Rope Walks and
16954	69	19	Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander,
16955	71	23	Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences
16956	72	21	setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies)
16957	71	18	at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet.
16958	72	23	And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales,
16959	72	18	in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at
16960	70	19	one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work
16961	35	9	was published so late as A.D. 1825.
16962	0	0	
16963	71	23	But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is
16964	69	20	as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time. And if ever I go where Pliny
16965	68	19	is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
16966	70	23	Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies
16967	70	22	that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not
16968	69	22	measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;
16969	72	22	and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian
16970	66	20	and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are
16971	72	17	drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle
16972	70	22	of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest
16973	72	21	of Pharaoh's fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of
16974	52	19	all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.
16975	0	0	
16976	65	22	But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
16977	72	24	recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs
16978	65	19	at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through
16979	67	18	Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers
16980	67	19	of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all
16981	72	23	continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure
16982	72	22	so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last
16983	71	20	be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man,
16984	66	20	smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.
16985	0	0	
16986	70	19	Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
16987	72	21	which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
16988	69	23	of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
16989	70	22	their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,
16990	71	21	where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such
16991	72	24	a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that
16992	53	17	the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.
16993	0	0	
16994	66	19	But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a
16995	70	26	period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in Illinois
16996	71	21	exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
16997	71	22	not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
16998	70	23	cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
16999	72	24	different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
17000	72	20	end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for
17001	70	17	forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God,
17002	70	19	if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days
17003	69	20	of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when
17004	67	18	the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and
17005	67	21	a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of
17006	70	22	months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
17007	70	20	not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need
17008	36	11	were, could be statistically stated.
17009	0	0	
17010	66	22	Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
17011	72	22	gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years
17012	63	17	(the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
17013	66	19	small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
17014	71	24	consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
17015	67	25	remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
17016	64	20	influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
17017	72	24	caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and
17018	71	21	pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely
17019	71	25	separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems
17020	67	22	the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer
17021	66	19	haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that
17022	62	19	species also is declining. For they are only being driven from
17023	64	21	promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with
17024	70	20	their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very
17025	46	13	recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
17026	0	0	
17027	70	22	Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
17028	70	20	firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
17029	72	21	impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss
17030	67	22	have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and
17031	70	21	glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to
17032	71	22	their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and
17033	72	21	walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle
17034	62	20	of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
17035	0	0	
17036	69	23	But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
17037	70	22	cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
17038	70	25	positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
17039	69	20	But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
17040	72	20	13,000, have been annually slain on the nor'-west coast by the Americans
17041	71	24	alone; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance
17042	63	20	of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.
17043	0	0	
17044	71	25	Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
17045	69	22	of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
17046	69	21	Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
17047	70	21	King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are
17048	72	24	numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no
17049	71	22	reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for
17050	71	18	thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the
17051	69	21	successive monarchs of the East--if they still survive there in great
17052	68	20	numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he
17053	71	24	has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all
17054	70	24	Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles
17055	20	7	of the sea combined.
17056	0	0	
17057	68	22	Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity
17058	66	21	of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
17059	71	26	therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
17060	66	21	must be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea
17061	70	21	of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
17062	72	23	creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children
17063	72	23	who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to
17064	42	14	the present human population of the globe.
17065	0	0	
17066	69	21	Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
17067	66	23	species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas
17068	68	22	before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
17069	66	20	Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah's flood he
17070	71	23	despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
17071	72	18	the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still
17072	68	23	survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood,
17073	40	13	spout his frothed defiance to the skies.

17080	69	23	The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
17081	70	22	Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to
17082	68	18	his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
17083	66	19	boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And
17084	68	20	when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
17085	68	20	vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it
17086	72	22	was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then,
17087	70	22	the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench,
17088	71	22	that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet
17089	42	12	Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.
17090	0	0	
17091	64	18	And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
17092	71	22	pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
17093	70	21	condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
17094	68	20	been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket, that he
17095	69	21	had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;
17096	71	23	by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
17097	69	21	ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise
17098	66	20	smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
17099	55	17	difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.
17100	0	0	
17101	70	22	Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
17102	72	22	the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
17103	72	25	former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous
17104	71	23	reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
17105	69	21	songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable
17106	69	22	events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought
17107	72	20	Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the
17108	67	17	ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is
17109	68	23	an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural
17110	72	19	enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,
17111	67	16	but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of
17112	68	20	all hell's despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still
17113	72	22	fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs
17114	66	18	beyond the grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an
17115	72	23	inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while
17116	68	24	even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying
17117	66	18	pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic
17118	68	22	significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their
17119	67	24	diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the
17120	71	25	genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the
17121	70	22	sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the
17122	72	17	glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must
17123	70	20	needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad.
17124	72	20	The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of
17125	22	6	sorrow in the signers.

17127	69	20	Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
17128	65	19	properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
17129	70	22	particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
17130	72	22	why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing
17131	67	20	of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like
17132	71	22	exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as
17133	69	23	it were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg's bruited
17134	68	23	reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed,
17135	68	24	as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every revelation partook more of
17136	71	19	significant darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all
17137	67	21	came out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at
17138	71	19	the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that
17139	72	21	ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed
17140	72	22	the privilege of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the
17141	71	24	above hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by
17142	72	21	Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land
17143	70	19	of spirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had
17144	67	19	all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of
17145	70	19	this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable
17146	63	19	interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod's decks.
17147	0	0	
17148	70	22	But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,
17149	67	22	or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
17150	72	20	with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain
17151	47	14	practical procedures;--he called the carpenter.
17152	0	0	
17153	72	24	And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay
17154	70	23	set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied
17155	71	17	with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus
17156	69	25	far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection
17157	72	21	of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the
17158	70	21	carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to
17159	67	21	provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to
17160	71	23	the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be
17161	69	23	hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate
17162	66	20	the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the
17163	54	17	forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.

17170	66	19	Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
17171	71	23	abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
17172	70	18	from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
17173	71	23	seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
17174	68	19	But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of
17175	70	22	the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod's carpenter was no duplicate;
17176	44	13	hence, he now comes in person on this stage.
17177	0	0	
17178	71	23	Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
17179	70	20	to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,
17180	72	25	alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own;
17181	71	21	the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all
17182	72	23	those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
17183	70	26	auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic
17184	70	23	remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in
17185	68	24	those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring
17186	67	24	in a large ship, upon a three or four years' voyage, in uncivilized
17187	67	21	and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary
17188	68	20	duties:--repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of
17189	72	20	clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails
17190	65	20	in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly
17191	66	23	pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly
17192	62	19	expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and
17193	11	5	capricious.
17194	0	0	
17195	71	23	The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
17196	70	22	was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
17197	69	21	vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
17198	65	19	except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
17199	47	12	athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
17200	0	0	
17201	70	25	A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
17202	72	22	the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway
17203	70	19	files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board,
17204	72	23	and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and
17205	70	22	cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking
17206	67	19	cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a
17207	69	22	soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon
17208	70	23	the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,
17209	70	22	the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes
17210	68	19	a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.
17211	66	20	Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping
17212	69	21	one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow
17213	71	24	unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the
17214	69	20	handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in
17215	42	12	that, if he would have him draw the tooth.
17216	0	0	
17217	70	21	Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
17218	70	22	and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
17219	71	17	deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But
17220	72	23	while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such
17221	71	24	liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some
17222	72	22	uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was
17223	68	22	this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as
17224	69	22	it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding
17225	65	21	infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity
17226	70	22	discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active
17227	69	22	in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you,
17228	69	21	though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible
17229	66	21	stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying
17230	62	16	heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,
17231	68	23	crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now
17232	69	19	and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served
17233	68	20	to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
17234	66	19	of Noah's ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long
17235	72	19	wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss;
17236	65	18	but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings
17237	68	20	might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an
17238	71	24	unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without
17239	66	20	premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost
17240	66	19	say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of
17241	70	23	unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so
17242	71	21	much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to
17243	70	21	it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by
17244	67	22	a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure
17245	63	21	manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early
17246	63	21	oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of
17247	69	21	those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN PARVO, Sheffield
17248	66	21	contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little swelled--of a
17249	70	22	common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,
17250	66	15	but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,
17251	67	22	nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the
17252	70	19	carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part
17253	70	18	of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the
17254	26	7	legs, and there they were.
17255	0	0	
17256	68	21	Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
17257	69	24	was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a
17258	70	23	common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
17259	69	19	did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
17260	71	19	drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it
17261	71	21	had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
17262	68	20	unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept
17263	72	25	him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning
17264	67	20	wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a
17265	68	20	sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the
17266	27	10	time to keep himself awake.

17285	65	17	Halloa, this bone dust is (SNEEZES)--why it's (SNEEZES)--yes it's
17286	68	17	(SNEEZES)--bless my soul, it won't let me speak! This is what an old

17288	67	21	you don't get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don't get it
17289	71	21	(SNEEZES). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let's have
17290	69	17	that ferule and buckle-screw; I'll be ready for them presently. Lucky
17291	72	21	now (SNEEZES) there's no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little;
17292	69	20	but a mere shinbone--why it's easy as making hop-poles; only I should
17293	71	23	like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I
17294	72	23	could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (SNEEZES) scraped to a lady
17295	69	20	in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in shop

17297	71	23	course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (SNEEZES) with washes and
17298	69	21	lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must
17299	69	17	call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right;

17389	68	21	It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
17390	70	20	was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
17391	72	23	soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a
17392	26	8	hair, do I. Is't a riddle?
17393	0	0	
17394	37	10	I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
17395	0	0	
17396	71	18	Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
17397	70	21	may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
17398	68	17	thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
17399	67	19	solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don't
17400	72	19	speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now
17401	70	18	so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery
17402	48	14	pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
17403	0	0	
17404	72	22	Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again;
17405	43	11	I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.
17406	0	0	
17407	72	21	Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long before the
17408	12	4	leg is done?

17410	21	6	Perhaps an hour, sir.

17412	72	20	Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (TURNS TO GO). Oh, Life! Here
17413	71	20	I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for
17414	71	20	a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will
17415	69	21	not do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I'm down in the
17416	70	20	whole world's books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with
17417	72	25	the wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was
17418	71	18	the world's); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By
17419	70	20	heavens! I'll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to
17420	36	12	one small, compendious vertebra. So.

17425	68	14	Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
17426	72	22	he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he's
17427	70	23	queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into
17428	68	21	Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very queer. And
17429	70	18	here's his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here's his bedfellow! has
17430	72	19	a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he'll stand
17431	70	20	on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and
17432	71	19	all three places standing in one hell--how was that? Oh! I don't wonder
17433	71	22	he looked so scornful at me! I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes,
17434	72	17	they say; but that's only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body
17435	71	24	like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall,
17436	71	20	heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick,
17437	67	18	and there's a great cry for life-boats. And here's the heron's leg!
17438	70	19	long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts
17439	67	22	a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a
17440	70	20	tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab;
17441	70	21	oh he's a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and spavined the
17442	71	21	other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there,
17443	66	18	you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and let's finish it
17444	64	20	before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for
17445	68	20	all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old beer
17446	71	22	barrels, to fill 'em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real
17447	71	19	live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he'll be standing on this
17448	71	22	to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the
17449	72	24	little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So,
17450	38	10	so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!

17457	70	20	According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
17458	68	22	inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
17459	70	17	sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into
17460	46	16	the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*

17463	69	22	*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
17464	72	22	is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench
17465	68	18	the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is
17466	67	17	removed by the ship's pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept
17467	72	17	damply tight; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the
17468	66	25	mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.

17471	71	20	Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
17472	69	23	the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
17473	66	20	the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with
17474	64	23	a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;
17475	68	23	and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
17476	70	21	Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new
17477	70	20	ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
17478	72	20	pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with his
17479	69	17	back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old
17480	14	6	courses again.
17481	0	0	
17482	70	20	"Who's there?" hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round

17484	0	0	
17485	72	23	"Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We
17486	31	9	must up Burtons and break out."
17487	0	0	
17488	71	24	"Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
17489	44	14	for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"
17490	0	0	
17491	72	24	"Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
17492	69	20	in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving,
17493	5	1	sir."

17495	35	10	"So it is, so it is; if we get it."

17497	45	13	"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir."
17498	0	0	
17499	72	21	"And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!
17500	72	20	I'm all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,
17501	72	20	but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a far worse plight
17502	69	17	than the Pequod's, man. Yet I don't stop to plug my leak; for who can
17503	64	20	find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if
17504	71	19	found, in this life's howling gale? Starbuck! I'll not have the Burtons
17505	9	3	hoisted."
17506	0	0	
17507	32	7	"What will the owners say, sir?"
17508	0	0	
17509	71	19	"Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
17510	68	19	cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck,
17511	68	21	about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But
17512	71	20	look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
17513	48	12	my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On deck!"
17514	0	0	
17515	71	22	"Captain Ahab," said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
17516	72	23	with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
17517	71	24	not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation
17518	71	21	of itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself;
17519	71	20	"A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
17520	69	24	enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab."
17521	0	0	
17522	70	19	"Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?--On
17523	6	1	deck!"
17524	0	0	
17525	71	21	"Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir--to be forbearing!
17526	71	21	Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?"
17527	0	0	
17528	63	19	Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
17529	67	20	South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
17530	65	21	exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
17531	48	14	Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!"
17532	0	0	
17533	70	20	For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
17534	70	23	you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
17535	67	20	the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose,
17536	71	22	and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: "Thou hast
17537	72	23	outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of
17538	72	23	Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of
17539	18	3	thyself, old man."
17540	0	0	
17541	68	19	"He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!"
17542	66	20	murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. "What's that he said--Ahab
17543	70	22	beware of Ahab--there's something there!" Then unconsciously using the
17544	71	20	musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
17545	66	19	cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
17546	51	13	returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
17547	0	0	
17548	70	21	"Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck," he said lowly to the mate;
17549	66	18	then raising his voice to the crew: "Furl the t'gallant-sails, and
17550	70	20	close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,
17551	32	10	and break out in the main-hold."
17552	0	0	
17553	70	20	It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
17554	70	20	Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;
17555	68	22	or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
17556	70	21	forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
17557	70	21	in the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders
17558	44	15	were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.

17565	69	18	Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
17566	67	18	were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it
17567	68	22	being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
17568	68	17	slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
17569	70	22	sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they
17570	71	21	go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
17571	72	22	puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask
17572	69	22	containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards,
17573	68	21	vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after
17574	69	21	tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and
17575	69	21	iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks
17576	68	22	were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if
17577	72	24	you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea
17578	70	22	like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless
17579	69	19	student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons
17580	24	6	did not visit them then.

17582	63	18	Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
17583	71	22	bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
17584	19	5	to his endless end.
17585	0	0	
17586	68	22	Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
17587	67	19	dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
17588	67	24	higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as
17589	72	22	harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but--as
17590	65	22	we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
17591	65	18	finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating
17592	67	22	all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
17593	70	21	clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,
17594	43	14	the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
17595	0	0	
17596	69	24	Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
17597	70	22	have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
17598	71	23	stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
17599	71	21	amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
17600	70	23	of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor
17601	67	19	pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
17602	69	20	caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after
17603	69	19	some days' suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
17604	64	20	of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few
17605	69	19	long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
17606	72	22	frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones
17607	71	20	grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller;
17608	66	18	they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply
17609	71	23	looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that
17610	68	22	immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like
17611	70	19	circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes
17612	69	22	seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that
17613	67	22	cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
17614	71	20	waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who
17615	71	21	were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous and
17616	70	20	fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing
17617	70	22	near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last
17618	69	23	revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.
17619	70	21	So that--let us say it again--no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and
17620	68	22	holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping
17621	64	23	over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying
17622	67	19	hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final
17623	71	22	rest, and the ocean's invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher
17624	28	9	towards his destined heaven.
17625	0	0	
17626	68	21	Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
17627	69	21	what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
17628	71	19	asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
17629	67	19	just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he
17630	68	22	had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
17631	70	23	war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
17632	68	23	whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
17633	72	20	and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not
17634	71	23	unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior,
17635	69	22	stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to
17636	69	20	the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars
17637	68	20	are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild,
17638	68	21	uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the
17639	63	18	white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at
17640	66	21	the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
17641	69	22	sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.
17642	70	25	No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial
17643	68	23	to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
17644	69	23	were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
17645	32	10	much lee-way adown the dim ages.
17646	0	0	
17647	69	18	Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
17648	65	21	was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might
17649	70	24	include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,
17650	68	23	which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
17651	69	18	groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
17652	67	22	was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of
17653	70	19	the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
17654	68	23	promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
17655	69	25	Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg's
17656	30	9	person as he shifted the rule.
17657	0	0	
17658	68	21	"Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ejaculated the Long Island
17659	7	3	sailor.
17660	0	0	
17661	71	23	Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
17662	72	21	reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
17663	70	18	was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches
17664	70	20	at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools,
17665	12	3	and to work.
17666	0	0	
17667	66	17	When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted,
17668	68	19	he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
17669	53	16	whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.
17670	0	0	
17671	64	20	Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the
17672	71	25	people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one's
17673	70	19	consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
17674	69	19	him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
17675	65	17	dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
17676	71	22	shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
17677	9	3	indulged.
17678	0	0	
17679	67	22	Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with
17680	70	22	an attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
17681	68	18	drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
17682	66	19	with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,
17683	72	21	biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water
17684	68	20	was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in
17685	69	22	the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a
17686	71	24	pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he
17687	70	20	might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving
17688	70	21	a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little
17689	69	19	god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he
17690	69	19	called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him.
17691	70	24	The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg
17692	72	23	in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view. "Rarmai"
17693	72	21	(it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced
17694	15	4	in his hammock.
17695	0	0	
17696	72	20	But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
17697	70	18	while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him
17698	50	14	by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
17699	0	0	
17700	70	21	"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
17701	69	20	go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where
17702	66	22	the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little
17703	69	20	errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who's now been missing long: I think
17704	68	18	he's in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he
17705	69	20	must be very sad; for look! he's left his tambourine behind;--I found
17706	72	22	it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I'll beat ye your dying
17707	7	1	march."
17708	0	0	
17709	68	18	"I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in
17710	67	22	violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;
17711	70	18	and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
17712	71	22	wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
17713	72	19	in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip,
17714	72	20	in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all
17715	70	21	our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?--Hark! he speaks
17716	28	8	again: but more wildly now."
17717	0	0	
17718	72	20	"Form two and two! Let's make a General of him! Ho, where's his harpoon?
17719	67	19	Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock
17720	69	22	now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!--mind ye that;
17721	69	28	Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I
17722	70	22	say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all
17723	71	20	a'shiver;--out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the Antilles
17724	70	20	he's a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped from
17725	66	23	a whale-boat! I'd never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail
17726	68	22	him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all
17727	71	19	cowards--shame upon them! Let 'em go drown like Pip, that jumped from a
17728	26	8	whale-boat. Shame! shame!"
17729	0	0	
17730	69	22	During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
17731	59	16	was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
17732	0	0	
17733	68	21	But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
17734	70	23	that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon
17735	69	22	there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon, when some
17736	68	20	expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
17737	69	22	cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical moment, he
17738	68	21	had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
17739	69	21	and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
17740	72	22	he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of
17741	71	22	his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word,
17742	71	24	it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere
17743	68	20	sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some
17744	60	19	violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
17745	0	0	
17746	70	23	Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
17747	64	18	that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,
17748	69	22	generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.
17749	65	20	So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after
17750	66	19	sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
17751	69	23	vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
17752	71	19	and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
17753	67	22	springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
17754	35	10	pronounced himself fit for a fight.
17755	0	0	
17756	67	19	With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
17757	68	19	emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
17758	64	17	Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
17759	64	20	grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
17760	68	19	striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
17761	72	21	his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and
17762	72	20	seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on
17763	71	21	his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical
17764	67	23	treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own
17765	72	23	proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but
17766	70	22	whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart
17767	65	22	beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore destined in
17768	67	20	the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were
17769	67	18	inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought it must
17770	68	21	have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when
17771	68	23	one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg--"Oh, devilish
17772	27	9	tantalization of the gods!"

17779	72	22	When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South
17780	71	23	Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific
17781	68	19	with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was
17782	71	25	answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues
17783	8	3	of blue.
17784	0	0	
17785	71	20	There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
17786	69	23	awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
17787	69	24	fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
17788	71	22	John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
17789	69	21	prairies and Potters' Fields of all four continents, the waves should
17790	72	21	rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed
17791	69	19	shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that
17792	68	20	we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like
17793	69	20	slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their
17794	13	3	restlessness.
17795	0	0	
17796	70	24	To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
17797	69	22	ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of
17798	69	21	the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same
17799	70	21	waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday
17800	66	18	planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
17801	71	23	gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
17802	64	16	float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
17803	68	23	Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine
17804	68	21	Pacific zones the world's whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay
17805	69	22	to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal
17806	70	21	swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
17807	0	0	
17808	65	18	But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an
17809	70	24	iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
17810	69	19	nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles
17811	70	19	(in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other
17812	69	22	consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
17813	67	19	which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at
17814	71	21	length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese
17815	72	21	cruising-ground, the old man's purpose intensified itself. His firm lips
17816	70	22	met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead's veins swelled
17817	69	19	like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through
17818	66	17	the vaulted hull, "Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!"

17825	69	22	Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
17826	61	22	these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
17827	70	20	pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old
17828	71	21	blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
17829	67	19	concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still retained
17830	70	18	it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost
17831	71	21	incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do
17832	70	21	some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
17833	70	25	various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an
17834	72	23	eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads,
17835	70	21	harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement,
17836	71	22	as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded
17837	70	23	by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from
17838	72	18	him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically
17839	65	21	broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the
17840	69	22	heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it
17841	21	6	was.--Most miserable!
17842	0	0	
17843	71	23	A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
17844	68	23	yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
17845	68	22	curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
17846	71	22	questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
17847	53	15	one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
17848	0	0	
17849	70	20	Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the road
17850	68	16	running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
17851	70	22	the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
17852	68	22	dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both
17853	69	22	feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
17854	72	20	acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth
17855	37	11	act of the grief of his life's drama.
17856	0	0	
17857	67	18	He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
17858	70	21	encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin. He had been
17859	68	22	an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
17860	70	22	and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three
17861	71	19	blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
17862	71	20	planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further
17863	71	24	concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into
17864	68	18	his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
17865	69	17	tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
17866	72	21	his family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that
17867	70	18	fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for
17868	70	19	prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in
17869	68	21	the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
17870	66	19	that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
17871	72	23	unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of
17872	70	20	her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by
17873	68	18	passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
17874	71	18	in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's
17875	31	9	infants were rocked to slumber.
17876	0	0	
17877	72	21	Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst
17878	69	20	thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon
17879	70	22	him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a
17880	69	22	truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and
17881	66	19	all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some
17882	69	21	virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the
17883	70	23	responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than useless
17884	72	24	old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to
17885	8	2	harvest.

17887	72	19	Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
17888	69	20	and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last;
17889	67	19	the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly
17890	68	19	gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the
17891	66	19	forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived
17892	69	17	down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her
17893	71	21	thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond
17894	69	22	in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen
17895	6	1	curls!
17896	0	0	
17897	71	24	Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death
17898	69	22	is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but
17899	68	24	the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the
17900	71	21	Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
17901	72	22	such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions against
17902	68	24	suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly
17903	65	20	spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and
17904	63	20	wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite
17905	59	17	Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them--"Come hither,
17906	70	26	broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
17907	66	21	death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come
17908	70	20	hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
17909	71	22	abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put
17910	71	19	up THY gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we
17911	12	3	marry thee!"
17912	0	0	
17913	72	21	Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall
17914	71	20	of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went
17915	10	3	a-whaling.

17922	69	19	With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
17923	67	18	mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
17924	70	23	placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
17925	70	20	coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab came
17926	69	19	along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
17927	70	21	yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,
17928	70	20	Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the
17929	69	16	anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
17930	33	10	some of which flew close to Ahab.

17932	69	17	"Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying
17933	70	20	in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here, they
17934	57	15	burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch."
17935	0	0	
17936	71	22	"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth, resting
17937	72	20	for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching; not easily can'st thou
17938	15	3	scorch a scar."
17939	0	0	
17940	71	19	"Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
17941	68	22	to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
17942	70	16	that is not mad. Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou
17943	72	22	not go mad? How can'st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet
17944	70	19	hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What wert thou making there?"
17945	0	0	
17946	66	19	"Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it."
17947	0	0	
17948	70	19	"And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
17949	17	6	usage as it had?"
17950	0	0	
17951	18	4	"I think so, sir."
17952	0	0	
17953	68	20	"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
17954	37	8	mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"
17955	0	0	
17956	55	15	"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."
17957	0	0	
17958	69	22	"Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
17959	65	17	with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--HERE--can ye
17960	71	22	smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across his
17961	67	18	ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay
17962	69	20	my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
17963	39	11	Answer! Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"
17964	0	0	
17965	67	19	"Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?"
17966	0	0	
17967	66	20	"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
17968	72	20	though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the
17969	71	16	bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles! But, away with child's play; no
17970	70	20	more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!" jingling the leathern bag,
17971	72	23	as if it were full of gold coins. "I, too, want a harpoon made; one that
17972	68	19	a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will
17973	68	18	stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There's the stuff," flinging
17974	70	21	the pouch upon the anvil. "Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered
17975	49	14	nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses."
17976	0	0	
17977	69	18	"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the
17978	53	12	best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work."
17979	0	0	
17980	71	19	"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
17981	68	21	melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
17982	72	16	first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these
17983	69	19	twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll
17984	15	4	blow the fire."
17985	0	0	
17986	71	20	When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
17987	69	18	spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. "A
17988	61	16	flaw!" rejecting the last one. "Work that over again, Perth."
17989	0	0	
17990	69	21	This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
17991	68	19	Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,
17992	70	19	with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to
17993	69	19	him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge
17994	71	21	shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and
17995	68	23	bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or
17996	65	21	some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
17997	0	0	
17998	72	19	"What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered Stubb,
17999	70	23	looking on from the forecastle. "That Parsee smells fire like a fusee;
18000	58	15	and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."
18001	0	0	
18002	71	22	At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
18003	71	20	Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
18004	53	14	by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.
18005	0	0	
18006	68	17	"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain;
18007	53	14	"have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?"
18008	0	0	
18009	68	19	"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
18010	29	9	harpoon for the White Whale?"
18011	0	0	
18012	64	17	"For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them
18013	71	19	thyself, man. Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make the
18014	48	14	barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."
18015	0	0	
18016	72	21	For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
18017	13	4	not use them.
18018	0	0	
18019	71	21	"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
18020	34	8	nor pray till--but here--to work!"
18021	0	0	
18022	66	19	Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
18023	72	20	shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith
18024	72	22	was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he
18025	43	14	cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
18026	0	0	
18027	69	20	"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
18028	71	23	there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
18029	72	19	as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high up. A cluster of
18030	71	21	dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh,
18031	47	13	and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.
18032	0	0	
18033	61	22	"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"
18034	71	23	deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
18035	16	5	baptismal blood.
18036	0	0	
18037	72	21	Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,
18038	70	19	with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of
18039	70	22	the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of
18040	68	19	it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing
18041	71	21	his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly
18042	69	21	bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and
18043	22	6	now for the seizings."
18044	0	0	
18045	71	22	At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
18046	68	22	were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole
18047	68	19	was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope
18048	72	18	was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured so, with
18049	72	22	intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope--like the Three
18050	67	23	Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the
18051	70	21	weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,
18052	70	20	both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,
18053	71	21	light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,
18054	68	16	Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange
18055	63	18	mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
18056	31	8	melancholy ship, and mocked it!

18063	71	23	Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
18064	69	20	ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
18065	72	22	pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the
18066	70	20	stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing,
18067	69	20	or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy
18068	69	20	minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success
18069	16	5	for their pains.
18070	0	0	
18071	68	21	At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
18072	66	20	heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
18073	70	20	sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
18074	65	20	cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
18075	66	22	quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
18076	68	20	ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
18077	65	18	would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
18078	17	5	remorseless fang.
18079	0	0	
18080	68	21	These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
18081	69	22	certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
18082	67	19	regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
18083	70	16	only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
18084	71	20	rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when
18085	71	21	the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears, while their
18086	54	18	hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
18087	0	0	
18088	68	19	The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
18089	66	20	there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
18090	69	22	children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
18091	71	20	the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most
18092	70	19	mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
18093	28	9	and form one seamless whole.
18094	0	0	
18095	68	21	Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
18096	69	21	temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem
18097	72	23	to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon
18098	26	7	them prove but tarnishing.
18099	0	0	
18100	69	19	Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
18101	72	19	ye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,--in ye,
18102	71	20	men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some
18103	69	21	few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.
18104	70	18	Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling
18105	70	18	threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
18106	69	19	storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this
18107	69	22	life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one
18108	66	19	pause:--through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless
18109	66	19	faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then
18110	72	23	disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once
18111	71	21	gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men,
18112	67	21	and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no
18113	68	19	more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will
18114	71	23	never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like
18115	71	22	those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
18116	65	21	our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.
18117	0	0	
18118	70	20	And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into that
18119	43	12	same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--
18120	0	0	
18121	64	21	"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's

18123	70	21	cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep

18137	70	20	And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
18138	69	22	before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.
18139	0	0	
18140	67	18	It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
18141	72	18	last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad
18142	71	24	holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing
18143	65	21	round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to
18144	27	8	pointing her prow for home.
18145	0	0	
18146	72	21	The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
18147	71	19	at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;
18148	72	20	and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
18149	69	18	last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours
18150	71	21	were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of
18151	70	20	her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her
18152	67	21	top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious
18153	54	16	fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.
18154	0	0	
18155	72	20	As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
18156	68	20	success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same
18157	69	24	seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a
18158	70	21	single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to
18159	70	24	make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental
18160	71	19	casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were
18161	70	20	stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms.
18162	72	22	Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the
18163	70	21	cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the
18164	68	23	floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually
18165	68	19	caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously
18166	66	20	added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and
18167	71	20	filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled
18168	66	21	it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and
18169	69	18	filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the
18170	71	20	captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands
18171	62	20	into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.
18172	0	0	
18173	67	20	As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
18174	71	23	barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
18175	66	20	still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
18176	72	18	try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach skin of
18177	70	20	the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
18178	70	21	hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were
18179	67	19	dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the
18180	71	23	Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
18181	72	22	aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with
18182	72	24	glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious
18183	70	21	jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at
18184	63	15	the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been
18185	72	22	removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed
18186	67	19	Bastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and
18187	38	13	mortar were being hurled into the sea.
18188	0	0	
18189	67	20	Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
18190	67	21	ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
18191	67	22	full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
18192	10	4	diversion.
18193	0	0	
18194	68	18	And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
18195	64	17	with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's
18196	71	22	wakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
18197	71	22	as to things to come--their two captains in themselves impersonated the
18198	37	10	whole striking contrast of the scene.
18199	0	0	
18200	71	22	"Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander, lifting
18201	32	10	a glass and a bottle in the air.
18202	0	0	
18203	51	14	"Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.
18204	0	0	
18205	72	21	"No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the other
18206	30	10	good-humoredly. "Come aboard!"
18207	0	0	
18208	56	15	"Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?"
18209	0	0	
18210	69	20	"Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,
18211	70	20	old hearty, come along. I'll soon take that black from your brow. Come
18212	67	16	along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and homeward-bound."
18213	0	0	
18214	71	24	"How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou art
18215	72	18	a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty
18216	72	19	ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!
18217	40	11	Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"
18218	0	0	
18219	71	22	And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
18220	69	18	stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew
18221	72	22	of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding
18222	72	22	Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for the lively
18223	70	22	revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the
18224	70	20	homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and
18225	67	19	then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two
18226	69	23	remote associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket
18227	10	3	soundings.

18234	70	21	Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites
18235	69	21	sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
18236	71	23	rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed
18237	69	21	it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,
18238	62	20	whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
18239	0	0	
18240	72	20	It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson
18241	67	19	fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun
18242	68	18	and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such
18243	72	22	plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that
18244	70	22	it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of
18245	71	21	the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had
18246	47	13	gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
18247	0	0	
18248	70	23	Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
18249	72	18	off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now
18250	72	21	tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
18251	70	18	dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring--that strange
18252	70	23	spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a
18253	28	9	wondrousness unknown before.

18255	68	15	"He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
18256	71	21	homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
18257	68	20	worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!--Oh
18258	68	24	that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.
18259	66	21	Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe;
18260	69	22	in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
18261	68	19	furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still
18262	66	19	rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the
18263	72	22	Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but
18264	69	21	see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it heads
18265	15	5	some other way.

18270	71	21	wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
18271	70	18	has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round

18277	68	19	only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker
18278	66	19	half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable

18291	67	22	The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
18292	69	22	windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These
18293	69	21	last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
18294	70	20	could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
18295	48	12	by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.
18296	0	0	
18297	70	21	The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; and
18298	66	18	the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare
18299	71	18	upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
18300	67	18	gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
18301	0	0	
18302	72	23	Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
18303	69	16	in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the
18304	66	18	whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound
18305	70	23	like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
18306	41	12	Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
18307	0	0	
18308	66	19	Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
18309	68	20	hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
18310	50	17	flooded world. "I have dreamed it again," said he.
18311	0	0	
18312	66	21	"Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
18313	21	6	coffin can be thine?"

18315	42	14	"And who are hearsed that die on the sea?"
18316	0	0	
18317	67	21	"But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
18318	69	20	hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
18319	67	19	mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
18320	9	4	America."
18321	0	0	
18322	65	20	"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumes
18323	71	22	floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
18324	29	8	sight we shall not soon see."
18325	0	0	
18326	65	20	"Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."

18334	70	21	so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
18335	56	14	pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."
18336	0	0	
18337	71	22	"Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
18338	56	16	like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee."

18340	70	20	"The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea," cried
18341	63	20	Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"
18342	0	0	
18343	66	20	Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
18344	67	21	slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead
18345	30	8	whale was brought to the ship.

18352	69	20	The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
18353	71	20	coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
18354	71	23	ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
18355	69	19	the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
18356	67	22	on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship's
18357	72	23	prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high
18358	64	20	noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
18359	69	24	about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
18360	9	4	latitude.
18361	0	0	
18362	64	20	Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
18363	67	20	effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
18364	69	20	focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks
18365	72	23	lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness
18366	72	24	of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God's throne.
18367	70	20	Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through
18368	68	19	which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form
18369	69	20	to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument
18370	66	22	placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to
18371	72	22	catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian.
18372	72	25	Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling
18373	68	18	beneath him on the ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's,
18374	71	21	was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded
18375	72	21	their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.
18376	69	21	At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon
18377	69	22	his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that
18378	72	23	precise instant. Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up
18379	70	20	towards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou sea-mark! thou high and
18380	71	19	mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou cast the
18381	70	20	least hint where I SHALL be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing
18382	71	20	besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou
18383	69	23	must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is
18384	70	23	even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally
18385	70	20	beholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!"
18386	0	0	
18387	67	19	Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
18388	68	24	numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
18389	72	21	"Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and
18390	69	16	Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what
18391	69	21	after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou
18392	68	17	thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds
18393	71	22	thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water
18394	71	21	or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence
18395	70	22	thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed
18396	71	20	be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live
18397	67	20	vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched
18398	70	19	with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth's horizon are the
18399	69	18	glances of man's eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God
18400	67	21	had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!"
18401	71	19	dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee;
18402	68	17	the level ship's compass, and the level deadreckoning, by log and by
18403	68	19	line; THESE shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,"
18404	72	19	lighting from the boat to the deck, "thus I trample on thee, thou paltry
18405	67	17	thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!"
18406	0	0	
18407	65	17	As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live
18408	67	22	and dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
18409	67	22	fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over
18410	71	24	the mute, motionless Parsee's face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
18411	71	21	while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
18412	66	19	together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,
18413	50	15	shouted out--"To the braces! Up helm!--square in!"
18414	0	0	
18415	70	19	In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
18416	66	21	her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon
18417	69	24	her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one
18418	17	6	sufficient steed.

18420	64	17	Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's

18425	68	20	to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine,

18430	72	21	mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine;
18431	68	17	swears that I must play them, and no others.' And damn me, Ahab, but

18443	66	22	resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all
18444	68	18	storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless
18445	57	16	sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

18447	67	19	Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
18448	68	17	bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
18449	67	19	ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
18450	70	17	thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
18451	67	17	fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
18452	37	9	tempest had left for its after sport.

18454	72	19	Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every
18455	70	21	flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster
18456	69	20	might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask
18457	71	21	were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the
18458	67	20	boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very
18459	69	20	top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab's) did not escape.
18460	68	20	A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship's high
18461	68	20	teetering side, stove in the boat's bottom at the stern, and left it
18462	41	14	again, all dripping through like a sieve.

18464	68	14	"Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
18465	72	20	"but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can't fight it. You see,
18466	69	19	Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all
18467	70	17	round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all
18468	68	20	the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never

18504	68	19	the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very
18505	67	20	course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is
18506	68	17	that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand--his

18514	70	21	question. "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
18515	70	20	into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,
18516	72	22	all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see it lightens up
18517	35	8	there; but not with the lightning."
18518	0	0	
18519	70	21	At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
18520	66	21	the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
18521	50	16	instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

18523	14	3	"Who's there?"
18524	0	0	
18525	67	18	"Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
18526	70	20	pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
18527	15	5	lances of fire.
18528	0	0	
18529	70	20	Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
18530	70	23	the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
18531	71	20	ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But
18532	70	19	as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
18533	68	19	avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
18534	69	22	towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
18535	68	20	not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
18536	68	20	vessel's way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
18537	70	21	ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
18538	70	22	in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
18539	69	24	chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.
18540	0	0	
18541	72	18	"The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to
18542	70	20	vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux,
18543	72	21	to light Ahab to his post. "Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and
18544	12	3	aft. Quick!"
18545	0	0	
18546	72	22	"Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the weaker
18547	72	22	side. Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that
18548	71	20	all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir."

18552	69	21	All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
18553	71	21	tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
18554	70	20	the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
18555	42	14	three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
18556	0	0	
18557	71	18	"Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
18558	71	22	sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
18559	62	15	jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. "Blast it!"--but
18560	71	19	slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
18561	72	22	immediately shifting his tone he cried--"The corpusants have mercy on us
18562	5	1	all!"
18563	0	0	
18564	71	22	To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
18565	69	19	the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
18566	68	20	from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething
18567	68	21	sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when
18568	69	19	God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His "Mene, Mene,
18569	64	20	Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
18570	0	0	
18571	70	19	While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
18572	65	19	enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
18573	69	23	all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
18574	72	21	constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic
18575	67	23	jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed
18576	68	18	the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of
18577	67	20	Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as
18578	62	17	if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the
18579	66	24	preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic blue
18580	19	5	flames on his body.

18582	70	22	The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more
18583	71	22	the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment
18584	72	21	or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It
18585	72	16	was Stubb. "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the

18588	69	19	"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
18589	71	18	hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?--have
18590	72	19	they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck--but it's too dark
18591	69	21	to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
18592	70	22	of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
18593	68	16	chock a' block with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will
18594	69	20	work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will
18595	68	20	yet be as three spermaceti candles--that's the good promise we saw."
18596	0	0	
18597	69	17	At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning
18598	71	20	to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and once
18599	68	22	more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
18600	33	11	supernaturalness in their pallor.
18601	0	0	
18602	58	16	"The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.

18604	69	22	At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
18605	69	21	the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head bowed away
18606	71	19	from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
18607	67	21	they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
18608	71	22	arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a
18609	72	21	knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted
18610	66	19	attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in
18611	67	23	Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes
18612	7	2	upcast.
18613	0	0	
18614	68	20	"Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab. "Look up at it; mark it well; the white
18615	67	19	flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast
18616	72	23	links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it;
18617	24	8	blood against fire! So."
18618	0	0	
18619	71	17	Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
18620	72	20	upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he
18621	59	18	stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
18622	0	0	
18623	69	23	"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
18624	72	20	once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to
18625	72	22	this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now
18626	70	21	know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence
18627	65	18	wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all
18628	67	19	are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,
18629	64	19	placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
18630	72	23	dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the
18631	72	24	personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a point at
18632	70	24	best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go; yet while I earthly live,
18633	72	21	the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights. But war
18634	69	21	is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will
18635	69	20	kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power;
18636	71	20	and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that
18637	69	20	in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy
18638	72	24	fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to
18639	6	2	thee."

18647	70	22	grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of
18648	70	20	these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning
18649	71	20	flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten
18650	69	21	brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh!
18651	66	18	Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou
18652	72	23	leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping
18653	71	24	out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the
18654	70	22	flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou
18655	69	17	art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what
18656	68	20	hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.
18657	63	18	Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten;
18658	69	18	certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I
18659	72	19	know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.
18660	71	22	There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom
18661	70	20	all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through
18662	66	17	thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou
18663	72	25	foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable
18664	71	23	riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read
18665	71	19	my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with
18666	64	19	thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!"

18668	66	17	"The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"

18670	70	21	Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed
18671	71	21	in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat's
18672	71	23	bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
18673	65	19	sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a
18674	71	23	levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there
18675	68	18	like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm--"God, God
18676	69	21	is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
18677	69	21	continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
18678	63	19	fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this."
18679	0	0	
18680	66	18	Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
18681	71	20	braces--though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast
18682	67	20	mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But
18683	67	15	dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the
18684	67	21	burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to
18685	67	19	transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end.
18686	69	18	Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
18687	66	18	that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:--
18688	0	0	
18689	67	21	"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
18690	69	19	heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye
18691	69	21	may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
18692	68	20	the last fear!" And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
18693	6	2	flame.

18695	70	21	As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of

18697	71	22	much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts;
18698	70	19	so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from him
18699	22	7	in a terror of dismay.

18740	68	20	will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long
18741	68	21	ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn't you once say that
18742	72	21	whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its
18743	71	22	insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft
18744	61	16	and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn't you say so?"
18745	0	0	
18746	70	17	"Well, suppose I did? What then? I've part changed my flesh since that
18747	67	19	time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with powder
18748	70	20	barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
18749	64	17	afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have
18750	71	22	pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now. Shake yourself; you're
18751	70	22	Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
18752	66	19	collar. Don't you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine
18753	72	24	Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But
18754	72	20	hark, again, and I'll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off
18755	66	18	from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope;
18756	65	17	now listen. What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's
18757	68	15	lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn't
18758	72	21	got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don't you see, you timber-head,
18759	72	19	that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first
18760	67	20	struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in a hundred
18761	66	20	carries rods, and Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more
18762	67	19	danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand
18763	72	22	ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would
18764	71	20	have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running
18765	68	23	up the corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather,
18766	72	18	and trailing behind like his sash. Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's
18767	72	19	easy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can be
18768	10	3	sensible."
18769	0	0	
18770	62	16	"I don't know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard."
18771	0	0	
18772	70	18	"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that's
18773	70	18	a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the
18774	70	20	turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
18775	65	21	now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two
18776	72	18	anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him. And what
18777	67	22	big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists,
18778	70	18	hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is
18779	69	19	anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable,
18780	65	17	though. There, hammer that knot down, and we've done. So; next to
18781	69	18	touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just
18782	70	16	wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs
18783	70	21	so, Flask; but seems to me, a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn
18784	70	19	in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry
18785	72	19	off the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end
18786	68	21	eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I
18787	69	21	must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew!
18788	71	20	there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come
18789	65	17	from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad."

18808	70	19	During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod's
18809	70	21	jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
18810	70	22	its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
18811	63	19	to it--for they were slack--because some play to the tiller was
18812	14	5	indispensable.

18814	70	22	In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
18815	66	20	to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
18816	65	18	compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the
18817	69	21	Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
18818	68	18	the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is
18819	67	20	a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
18820	8	4	emotion.

18822	71	20	Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
18823	70	22	strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward and the
18824	71	21	other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
18825	70	20	were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
18826	72	21	the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when
18827	38	9	that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
18828	0	0	
18829	65	20	The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
18830	69	17	storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
18831	69	22	the water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,
18832	69	22	East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
18833	71	21	given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
18834	69	21	steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the
18835	72	22	ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo!
18836	70	23	a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze
18837	12	5	became fair!
18838	0	0	
18839	64	17	Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of "HO! THE
18840	68	17	FAIR WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!" the crew singing for joy, that so
18841	66	22	promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
18842	13	4	preceding it.

18844	65	19	In compliance with the standing order of his commander--to report
18845	72	23	immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change
18846	72	20	in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to
18847	72	21	the breeze--however reluctantly and gloomily,--than he mechanically went
18848	50	17	below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
18849	0	0	
18850	65	23	Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it
18851	67	16	a moment. The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was
18852	70	18	burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's bolted
18853	72	21	door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels.
18854	66	24	The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
18855	69	22	silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of
18856	72	22	the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as
18857	72	20	they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest,
18858	69	18	upright man; but out of Starbuck's heart, at that instant when he saw
18859	71	19	the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with
18860	70	20	its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew
18861	14	4	it for itself.
18862	0	0	
18863	72	20	"He would have shot me once," he murmured, "yes, there's the very musket
18864	69	19	that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let me touch
18865	69	18	it--lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances,
18866	70	22	strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and
18867	68	17	powder in the pan;--that's not good. Best spill it?--wait. I'll cure
18868	66	16	myself of this. I'll hold the musket boldly while I think.--I come
18869	62	19	to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and
18870	71	18	doom,--THAT'S fair for Moby Dick. It's a fair wind that's only fair for
18871	67	19	that accursed fish.--The very tube he pointed at me!--the very one;
18872	71	21	THIS one--I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I
18873	69	20	handle now.--Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say
18874	72	20	he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly
18875	72	23	quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere
18876	72	21	dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did
18877	72	19	he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed
18878	70	20	old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom
18879	71	19	with him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
18880	71	19	more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my
18881	72	20	soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this
18882	71	21	instant--put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in
18883	68	19	his sleep? Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping. Sleeping? aye,
18884	72	22	but still alive, and soon awake again. I can't withstand thee, then, old
18885	72	22	man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to;
18886	72	19	all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is
18887	70	17	all thou breathest. Aye, and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st
18888	69	21	all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!--But is there no other way? no
18889	70	21	lawful way?--Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest
18890	66	17	this old man's living power from his own living hands? Only a fool
18891	68	21	would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes
18892	69	19	and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would
18893	64	22	be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the
18894	70	16	sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,
18895	71	26	inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What,
18896	69	21	then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan
18897	69	24	the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and
18898	68	22	a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis so.--Is heaven
18899	69	20	a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed,
18900	69	20	tindering sheets and skin together?--And would I be a murderer, then,
18901	69	18	if"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the
18902	37	12	loaded musket's end against the door.

18904	66	17	"On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way. A
18905	68	20	touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh
18906	70	18	Mary! Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
18907	66	18	who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day week
18908	70	17	may sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall
18909	71	20	I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
18910	42	14	are reefed and set; she heads her course."

18912	54	11	"Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!"

18914	66	18	Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
18915	70	21	tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb dream
18916	9	3	to speak.

18918	70	21	The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the panel;
18919	70	19	Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
18920	54	15	placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.

18930	68	19	Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
18931	71	17	mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her on
18932	70	22	like giants' palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
18933	67	19	so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world
18934	72	21	boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible
18935	66	17	sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his
18936	71	21	bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian
18937	71	23	kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of
18938	55	13	molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
18939	0	0	
18940	71	24	Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
18941	72	20	the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
18942	72	18	the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by
18943	70	18	the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's rearward place, and how
18944	61	19	the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.
18945	0	0	
18946	72	20	"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
18947	70	19	the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
18948	63	19	Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!"
18949	0	0	
18950	72	21	But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
18951	49	13	helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
18952	0	0	
18953	52	16	"East-sou-east, sir," said the frightened steersman.
18954	0	0	
18955	71	19	"Thou liest!" smiting him with his clenched fist. "Heading East at this
18956	41	11	hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"
18957	0	0	
18958	65	20	Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
18959	71	23	observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
18960	47	15	blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
18961	0	0	
18962	70	21	Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse
18963	70	19	of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
18964	71	20	seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two
18965	68	21	compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
18966	0	0	
18967	65	20	But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew,
18968	69	22	the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I have it! It has happened
18969	71	17	before. Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our compasses--that's
18970	60	18	all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it."
18971	0	0	
18972	71	23	"Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the pale mate,
18973	9	3	gloomily.
18974	0	0	
18975	71	22	Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
18976	69	21	one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
18977	72	23	developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
18978	70	22	the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled
18979	65	16	at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has
18980	69	19	actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and
18981	71	22	rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal;
18982	71	25	all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic
18983	67	21	steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle. But in
18984	69	25	either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original
18985	70	21	virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected,
18986	71	22	the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were
18987	43	14	the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
18988	0	0	
18989	70	23	Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
18990	69	18	compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
18991	67	22	the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
18992	68	21	exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's course to be
18993	69	20	changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod
18994	71	21	thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
18995	31	9	one had only been juggling her.
18996	0	0	
18997	72	21	Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
18998	70	22	but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask--who
18999	69	23	in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings--likewise
19000	67	20	unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly
19001	71	23	rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as
19002	70	24	ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed;
19003	69	21	or if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
19004	40	13	congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab's.
19005	0	0	
19006	64	19	For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But
19007	63	17	chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
19008	69	20	sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
19009	0	0	
19010	67	21	"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked
19011	70	21	thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But
19012	72	22	Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck--a lance without
19013	65	20	a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's needles.
19014	7	2	Quick!"
19015	0	0	
19016	71	21	Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
19017	71	24	to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
19018	69	20	revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
19019	70	21	matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old
19020	68	18	man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
19021	72	23	practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
19022	43	13	without some shudderings and evil portents.
19023	0	0	
19024	66	19	"Men," said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed
19025	70	17	him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thunder turned old Ahab's
19026	72	23	needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that
19027	27	8	will point as true as any."
19028	0	0	
19029	72	22	Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this
19030	68	22	was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
19031	33	10	follow. But Starbuck looked away.
19032	0	0	
19033	68	20	With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
19034	69	21	lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
19035	72	19	him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul,
19036	70	21	after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the
19037	67	19	blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered
19038	67	19	that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then
19039	71	21	going through some small strange motions with it--whether indispensable
19040	70	23	to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe
19041	72	21	of the crew, is uncertain--he called for linen thread; and moving to the
19042	70	22	binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally
19043	71	21	suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards.
19044	68	20	At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at
19045	67	19	either end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had
19046	69	16	been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the
19047	70	20	binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look
19048	71	22	ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun
19049	37	10	is East, and that compass swears it!"
19050	0	0	
19051	70	23	One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
19052	67	22	persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk
19053	5	2	away.
19054	0	0	
19055	68	20	In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
19056	12	4	fatal pride.

19060	30	7	CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
19061	0	0	
19062	0	0	
19063	71	23	While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
19064	71	24	and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
19065	69	21	upon other means of determining the vessel's place, some merchantmen,
19066	72	21	and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the
19067	70	20	log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form's sake than
19068	66	19	anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
19069	67	22	course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
19070	68	22	progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
19071	68	21	reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
19072	69	19	railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
19073	69	19	wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
19074	67	20	hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
19075	72	22	happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene,
19076	72	22	and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic
19077	67	20	oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing plungingly;
19078	35	10	astern the billows rolled in riots.
19079	0	0	
19080	32	9	"Forward, there! Heave the log!"

19082	72	22	Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. "Take
19083	33	11	the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."
19084	0	0	
19085	70	19	They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where the
19086	70	20	deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
19087	33	10	the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
19088	0	0	
19089	68	18	The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
19090	70	20	handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
19091	72	20	stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.
19092	0	0	
19093	69	19	Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
19094	69	20	turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
19095	68	19	Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
19096	6	2	speak.
19097	0	0	
19098	69	20	"Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
19099	12	4	spoiled it."
19100	0	0	
19101	71	19	"'Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
19102	71	20	Thou seem'st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it."
19103	0	0	
19104	63	16	"I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these
19105	68	19	grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a
19106	32	9	superior, who'll ne'er confess."
19107	0	0	
19108	63	18	"What's that? There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
19109	70	22	granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient. Where wert
19110	11	3	thou born?"
19111	0	0	
19112	39	10	"In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir."

19114	43	9	"Excellent! Thou'st hit the world by that."
19115	0	0	
19116	40	10	"I know not, sir, but I was born there."
19117	0	0	
19118	70	19	"In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it's good. Here's a man
19119	70	20	from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
19120	67	16	which is sucked in--by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
19121	51	14	butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So."
19122	0	0	
19123	70	23	The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
19124	70	18	dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
19125	69	18	turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
19126	66	20	resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
19127	0	0	
19128	12	2	"Hold hard!"
19129	0	0	
19130	72	22	Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging
19131	13	4	log was gone.

19133	69	18	"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
19134	70	22	sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
19135	70	21	reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
19136	31	10	mend thou the line. See to it."
19137	0	0	
19138	68	19	"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer

19140	70	22	Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and

19143	70	17	"Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip's missing.

19145	70	19	hard; I guess he's holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul
19146	71	20	in no cowards here. Ho! there's his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!
19147	69	21	a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,

19175	69	20	perhaps he had ne'er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;
19176	70	18	something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come

19190	68	19	line--all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new
19191	46	14	line altogether. I'll see Mr. Stubb about it."

19198	70	20	Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her progress
19199	66	20	solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod held on
19200	67	20	her path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
19201	72	21	unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled
19202	72	22	by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed
19203	67	21	the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.
19204	0	0	
19205	69	19	At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
19206	72	24	Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the
19207	70	18	dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then headed
19208	71	17	by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly--like
19209	63	19	half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod's murdered
19210	70	20	Innocents--that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for
19211	67	20	the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfixedly
19212	68	20	listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained
19213	71	22	within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was
19214	71	24	mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled.
19215	71	19	Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest mariner of all--declared that the wild
19216	70	20	thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men
19217	11	4	in the sea.
19218	0	0	
19219	68	18	Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when
19220	63	17	he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
19221	70	21	unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus
19222	21	7	explained the wonder.
19223	0	0	
19224	72	20	Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
19225	69	20	of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams
19226	72	18	that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company
19227	68	17	with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this
19228	68	22	only the more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a
19229	67	23	very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their
19230	70	22	peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their
19231	68	22	round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from
19232	72	24	the water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have
19233	37	12	more than once been mistaken for men.
19234	0	0	
19235	69	23	But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
19236	64	21	confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At
19237	69	19	sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
19238	69	18	and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
19239	70	23	sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus
19240	65	17	with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he
19241	65	16	had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a
19242	67	19	rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
19243	70	22	looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
19244	4	2	sea.
19245	0	0	
19246	72	19	The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where it
19247	71	22	always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
19248	71	19	and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
19249	71	20	slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and
19250	71	22	the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
19251	53	16	yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
19252	0	0	
19253	70	21	And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out
19254	71	21	for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own peculiar ground; that man
19255	70	19	was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the
19256	67	21	time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
19257	72	23	least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil
19258	70	22	in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They
19259	69	19	declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had
19260	59	18	heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
19261	0	0	
19262	71	22	The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see
19263	68	20	to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as
19264	66	22	in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
19265	70	21	the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
19266	62	17	connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;
19267	70	22	therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a
19268	72	24	buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint
19269	22	6	concerning his coffin.

19271	52	15	"A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.

19278	66	18	"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck, after a
19279	71	21	melancholy pause. "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the coffin,
19280	35	11	I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it."
19281	0	0	
19282	71	18	"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a hammer.

19284	6	2	"Aye."

19289	6	2	"Aye."
19290	0	0

19294	71	22	"Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and
19295	54	11	no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me."
19296	0	0	
19297	72	21	"He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.
19298	69	22	Now I don't like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it
19299	69	23	like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won't put
19300	70	20	his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin?
19301	71	23	And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like turning an old
19302	71	20	coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don't like this
19303	68	20	cobbling sort of business--I don't like it at all; it's undignified;
19304	65	17	it's not my place. Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are their
19305	71	23	betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square
19306	72	21	mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and
19307	72	21	is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not
19308	72	19	a cobbler's job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at
19309	70	16	the end. It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord!
19310	72	22	what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of
19311	72	21	sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's
19312	69	22	the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when
19313	71	20	I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their
19314	71	21	lonely old heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at
19315	70	20	sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay
19316	70	17	over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the
19317	68	18	snap-spring over the ship's stern. Were ever such things done before
19318	68	22	with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied
19319	68	19	up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I'm made of knotty
19320	66	21	Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing
19321	70	21	about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make
19322	68	19	bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We
19323	69	15	work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask
19324	72	22	the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling,
19325	68	16	and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I'll do the job, now, tenderly.
19326	70	17	I'll have me--let's see--how many in the ship's company, all told? But
19327	68	20	I've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed
19328	71	21	life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then,
19329	71	17	if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for
19330	69	21	one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer,
19331	58	15	caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it."

19378	0	0	
19379	69	18	"Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that; but
19380	71	24	the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there

19436	71	19	Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
19437	66	17	upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the
19438	67	21	time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
19439	71	19	broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
19440	70	18	fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
19441	17	4	the smitten hull.
19442	0	0	
19443	70	17	"Bad news; she brings bad news," muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
19444	67	20	commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
19445	45	15	could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.

19447	28	8	"Hast seen the White Whale?"
19448	0	0	
19449	51	17	"Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?"
19450	0	0	
19451	70	22	Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
19452	72	21	and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
19453	65	17	himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen descending her
19454	68	21	side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod's
19455	72	21	main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by
19456	71	23	Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.
19457	0	0	
19458	72	19	"Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!" cried Ahab, closely advancing.
19459	13	3	"How was it?"
19460	0	0	
19461	72	25	It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
19462	72	21	three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which
19463	71	21	had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were
19464	72	19	yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had
19465	72	23	suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon,
19466	69	22	the fourth rigged boat--a reserved one--had been instantly lowered in
19467	72	22	chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest
19468	66	23	keeled of all--seemed to have succeeded in fastening--at least, as
19469	69	20	well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the
19470	66	20	distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam
19471	67	19	of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was
19472	70	21	concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with
19473	67	21	his pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no
19474	70	21	positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging;
19475	65	18	darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward
19476	69	24	boats--ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite
19477	72	24	direction--the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to
19478	72	22	its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance
19479	72	20	from it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded
19480	71	22	all sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a fire
19481	72	22	in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out.
19482	69	22	But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the
19483	65	19	presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she then
19484	71	22	paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding
19485	71	23	anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and

19487	42	13	glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.

19489	70	21	The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
19490	69	22	object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his
19491	66	22	own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
19492	71	24	apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.

19494	70	19	"I will wager something now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "that some one
19495	67	19	in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap, his
19496	67	20	watch--he's so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
19497	72	24	pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of
19498	71	22	the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks--pale in the
19499	69	20	very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the coat--it must have been
19500	6	1	the--"

19502	59	14	"My boy, my own boy is among them. For God's sake--I beg, I
19503	67	21	conjure"--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far
19504	70	22	had but icily received his petition. "For eight-and-forty hours let me
19505	71	18	charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it--if
19506	69	19	there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only that--you
19507	49	12	must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing."

19509	68	16	"His son!" cried Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's lost! I take back the
19510	55	14	coat and watch--what says Ahab? We must save that boy."

19512	66	15	"He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night," said the old Manx
19513	70	20	sailor standing behind them; "I heard; all of ye heard their spirits."
19514	0	0	
19515	70	19	Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel's
19516	71	20	the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
19517	69	19	Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew; but among
19518	72	21	the number of the other boat's crews, at the same time, but on the other
19519	72	21	hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase,
19520	66	19	there had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched
19521	67	18	father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which
19522	70	19	was only solved for him by his chief mate's instinctively adopting the
19523	69	22	ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when
19524	67	22	placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the
19525	72	23	majority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason,
19526	68	19	had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by
19527	70	22	Ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad,
19528	67	20	but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving
19529	68	22	hardihood of a Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to
19530	72	26	initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially
19531	65	19	the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that
19532	69	20	Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them,
19533	68	22	for a protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than
19534	69	20	their own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall
19535	71	22	be unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely
19536	50	17	partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.
19537	0	0	
19538	70	22	Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
19539	70	22	and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
19540	31	10	the least quivering of his own.
19541	0	0	
19542	69	20	"I will not go," said the stranger, "till you say aye to me. Do to me
19543	72	27	as you would have me do to you in the like case. For YOU too have a boy,
19544	68	20	Captain Ahab--though but a child, and nestling safely at home now--a
19545	68	21	child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see it--run, run,
19546	47	11	men, now, and stand by to square in the yards."
19547	0	0	
19548	66	20	"Avast," cried Ahab--"touch not a rope-yarn"; then in a voice that
19549	69	20	prolongingly moulded every word--"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
19550	70	21	Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
19551	72	18	forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
19552	70	18	and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:
19553	59	18	then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before."
19554	0	0	
19555	66	20	Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
19556	70	23	leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
19557	68	20	rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,
19558	70	21	Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
19559	31	9	boat, and returned to his ship.
19560	0	0	
19561	71	20	Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
19562	71	20	was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
19563	72	19	however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;
19564	69	22	starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a
19565	69	23	head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her
19566	69	16	masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry
19567	52	14	trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
19568	0	0	
19569	72	20	But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
19570	71	18	that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.
19571	64	19	She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.

19619	71	19	door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there's no opening
19620	72	19	it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this
19621	70	20	screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom,
19622	70	19	in the ship's full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me.

19642	67	20	And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
19643	68	21	preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to
19644	69	23	have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
19645	63	17	there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
19646	67	21	longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a
19647	67	19	vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
19648	69	20	encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with
19649	71	23	various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference
19650	70	19	with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned
19651	72	21	against; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes,
19652	72	22	which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting
19653	65	15	polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months' night
19654	66	20	sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now
19655	70	19	fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
19656	69	21	domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
19657	68	22	fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
19658	21	7	single spear or leaf.
19659	0	0	
19660	65	21	In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
19661	72	23	vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove
19662	68	22	to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to
19663	65	18	finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of
19664	71	22	Ahab's iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever
19665	52	15	conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.
19666	0	0	
19667	71	22	But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
19668	70	22	he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
19669	71	22	even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable Parsee's glance
19670	71	22	awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
19671	68	19	Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
19672	70	22	now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
19673	69	23	at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
19674	71	23	substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
19675	67	17	being's body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by
19676	69	20	night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
19677	71	20	below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
19678	62	17	but wondrous eyes did plainly say--We two watchmen never rest.
19679	0	0	
19680	70	19	Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
19681	72	22	deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or
19682	72	21	exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,--the main-mast
19683	71	19	and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,--his
19684	67	20	living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched
19685	71	24	heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he stood, however the
19686	68	17	days and nights were added on, that he had not swung in his hammock;
19687	71	20	yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never tell unerringly
19688	71	20	whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether
19689	69	18	he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in
19690	72	20	the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp
19691	65	20	gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The
19692	71	18	clothes that the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him;
19693	69	19	and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath
19694	69	17	the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.
19695	0	0	
19696	72	22	He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast and
19697	72	20	dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew
19698	69	19	all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow
19699	71	22	idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though
19700	72	22	his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee's
19701	69	20	mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never
19702	68	22	seemed to speak--one man to the other--unless at long intervals some
19703	72	22	passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent spell
19704	70	20	seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew,
19705	72	22	they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one word;
19706	70	17	by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal
19707	69	21	interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they
19708	69	19	stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by
19709	68	20	the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
19710	71	24	Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned
19711	10	3	substance.
19712	0	0	
19713	69	19	And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
19714	67	21	and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab
19715	70	22	seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
19716	72	22	seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade
19717	70	20	siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel
19718	15	5	was solid Ahab.

19720	70	21	At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
19721	69	16	from aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and all through the day, till after
19722	72	22	sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of
19723	63	13	the helmsman's bell, was heard--"What d'ye see?--sharp! sharp!"

19725	60	17	But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
19726	71	23	children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
19727	70	20	old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at least, of nearly
19728	67	22	all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether
19729	72	18	Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if
19730	72	24	these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally
19731	61	17	expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
19732	0	0	
19733	66	17	"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"--he said. "Aye!
19734	68	20	Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest
19735	69	21	of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
19736	71	22	block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
19737	72	23	downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
19738	70	20	the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that
19739	69	21	end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon
19740	70	21	his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon
19741	72	22	Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his
19742	72	23	firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give
19743	70	17	it into thy hands, Starbuck." Then arranging his person in the basket,
19744	67	18	he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being
19745	71	22	the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And
19746	68	20	thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad
19747	64	20	upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and
19748	70	21	that,--within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.
19749	0	0	
19750	69	20	When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
19751	70	21	the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is
19752	69	21	hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
19753	72	20	circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
19754	66	22	to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a
19755	70	23	wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft
19756	68	19	cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the
19757	71	21	deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes
19758	70	20	cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,
19759	70	21	unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some
19760	68	19	carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the
19761	68	22	sea. So Ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only
19762	68	20	strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one
19763	65	19	only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the
19764	65	23	slightest degree approaching to decision--one of those too, whose
19765	69	23	faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was
19766	70	17	strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman;
19767	71	22	freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's
19768	6	1	hands.
19769	0	0	
19770	69	21	Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
19771	68	21	minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
19772	69	23	incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
19773	72	24	latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
19774	72	21	in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet
19775	69	19	straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying
19776	21	8	again round his head.
19777	0	0	
19778	69	22	But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
19779	71	21	not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
19780	69	20	it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least
19781	70	25	heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
19782	6	1	sight.
19783	0	0	
19784	66	20	"Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
19785	71	21	being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though
19786	67	21	somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
19787	5	1	them.
19788	0	0	
19789	66	19	But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long
19790	71	20	hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with
19791	10	3	his prize.

19793	70	23	An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to replace
19794	65	22	it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would
19795	67	18	be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
19796	72	21	accounted good. Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and
19797	70	21	on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while
19798	67	20	from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly
19799	54	15	discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.

19806	69	20	The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
19807	70	18	life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
19808	67	19	misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
19809	72	20	fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships,
19810	70	21	cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to
19811	45	13	carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
19812	0	0	
19813	69	19	Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
19814	71	22	some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
19815	69	20	now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
19816	49	15	half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
19817	0	0	
19818	28	8	"Hast seen the White Whale?"
19819	0	0	
19820	70	21	"Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with
19821	36	10	his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
19822	0	0	
19823	18	4	"Hast killed him?"
19824	0	0	
19825	68	19	"The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that," answered the
19826	72	21	other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
19827	58	20	sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
19828	0	0	
19829	71	17	"Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
19830	72	22	held it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold
19831	72	20	his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs;
19832	67	18	and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin,
19833	52	16	where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"
19834	0	0	
19835	64	18	"Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that"--pointing to the
19836	63	20	hammock--"I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
19837	71	21	yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only THAT one I bury; the rest were
19838	71	23	buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb." Then turning to his
19839	64	18	crew--"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
19840	69	16	lift the body; so, then--Oh! God"--advancing towards the hammock with
19841	53	15	uplifted hands--"may the resurrection and the life--"
19842	0	0	
19843	63	17	"Brace forward! Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
19844	0	0	
19845	72	23	But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
19846	68	19	of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
19847	71	19	quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
19848	36	8	her hull with their ghostly baptism.
19849	0	0	
19850	67	20	As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
19851	59	20	hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.

19853	69	22	"Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.

19855	33	10	taffrail to show us your coffin!"

19862	65	22	It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were
19863	71	22	hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
19864	68	18	transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and
19865	68	18	man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson's
19866	19	5	chest in his sleep.
19867	0	0	
19868	67	16	Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
19869	69	21	unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
19870	68	19	but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
19871	69	16	mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
19872	51	17	troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
19873	0	0	
19874	71	18	But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
19875	71	22	shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
19876	24	7	that distinguished them.
19877	0	0	
19878	68	20	Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
19879	68	21	air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the
19880	68	22	girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen
19881	66	19	here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
19882	54	16	alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
19883	0	0	
19884	70	17	Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm
19885	67	19	and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
19886	67	21	ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
19887	64	17	morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's
19888	19	8	forehead of heaven.
19889	0	0	
19890	66	21	Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
19891	71	21	creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
19892	68	26	oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
19893	71	23	little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
19894	70	18	their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
19895	48	14	the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
19896	0	0	
19897	72	20	Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
19898	71	20	watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more
19899	68	20	and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely
19900	70	22	aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment,
19901	67	19	the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome
19902	70	16	sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long
19903	71	20	cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck,
19904	67	22	and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however
19905	68	20	wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to
19906	70	22	bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea;
19907	65	20	nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.
19908	0	0	
19909	71	21	Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
19910	72	24	and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
19911	68	23	stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch
19912	68	19	him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.

19918	6	1	"Sir."
19919	0	0	
19920	71	17	"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such
19921	69	17	a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first whale--a
19922	70	21	boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty--forty--forty years ago!--ago! Forty
19923	68	21	years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
19924	69	20	storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
19925	70	21	forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
19926	71	22	of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
19927	72	23	spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation
19928	64	21	of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain's
19929	71	18	exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
19930	72	25	green country without--oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of
19931	72	18	solitary command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so
19932	70	20	keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon dry
19933	68	18	salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when the
19934	70	19	poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the
19935	70	18	world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole oceans away, from
19936	66	19	that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn
19937	63	19	the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow--wife?
19938	70	23	wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor
19939	69	16	girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy,
19940	66	18	the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand
19941	67	21	lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey--more a
19942	70	21	demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a forty years' fool--fool--old fool,
19943	69	17	has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy
19944	66	19	the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or
19945	72	18	better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this
19946	68	23	weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under
19947	71	21	me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.
19948	67	20	Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look
19949	70	18	very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and
19950	59	19	humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled
19951	67	18	centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!--crack my heart!--stave my
19952	68	18	brain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have
19953	70	23	I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?
19954	71	22	Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is
19955	69	20	better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By
19956	68	16	the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass,
19957	71	20	man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on
19958	72	20	board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.
19959	72	21	That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see
19960	13	4	in that eye!"
19961	0	0	
19962	72	18	"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
19963	66	20	should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us
19964	62	18	fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are
19965	66	15	Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
19966	64	18	youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
19967	72	21	longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!--this instant let me alter
19968	70	22	the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl
19969	72	23	on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such
19970	44	12	mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."
19971	0	0	
19972	64	19	"They have, they have. I have seen them--some summer days in the
19973	62	18	morning. About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy
19974	69	20	vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
19975	70	22	cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
19976	20	7	to dance him again."

19978	72	15	"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,

19980	68	20	sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my
19981	72	23	Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy's face
19982	45	10	from the window! the boy's hand on the hill!"
19983	0	0	
19984	71	22	But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
19985	42	12	cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.

19987	68	18	"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
19988	64	19	cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
19989	69	20	commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
19990	69	16	pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
19991	71	20	making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not
19992	69	19	so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this
19993	70	20	arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
19994	72	23	in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power;
19995	66	18	how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think
19996	69	19	thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that
19997	67	20	living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in
19998	68	18	this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all
19999	69	20	the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon
20000	71	20	Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where
20001	70	19	do murderers go, man! Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged
20002	68	17	to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
20003	72	22	the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been
20004	69	20	making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the
20005	70	22	mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how
20006	68	20	we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid
20007	70	16	greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut
20008	18	3	swaths--Starbuck!"

20021	62	14	That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at
20022	70	18	intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
20023	69	20	to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
20024	65	21	up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing nigh to
20025	69	23	some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
20026	63	21	peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the
20027	70	19	living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner
20028	72	19	surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and
20029	72	24	then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible,
20030	70	20	Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be slightly altered, and the
20031	21	7	sail to be shortened.
20032	0	0	
20033	70	23	The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
20034	65	18	at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
20035	69	22	lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
20036	69	20	wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
20037	47	15	tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.

20041	71	20	Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
20042	67	18	deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
20043	69	23	seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
20044	34	9	with their clothes in their hands.
20045	0	0	
20046	60	16	"What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.

20051	0	0	
20052	65	21	All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
20053	71	21	swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
20054	66	17	hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft,
20055	66	22	and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
20056	68	21	main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
20057	71	19	air. "There she blows!--there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
20058	11	2	Moby Dick!"
20059	0	0	
20060	66	19	Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
20061	69	21	look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
20062	67	21	whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final
20063	66	21	perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
20064	68	19	beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's
20065	71	21	head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale
20066	70	25	was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
20067	72	19	his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the
20068	71	24	air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had
20069	61	21	so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

20074	70	20	"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I

20078	70	24	reserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the
20079	71	17	White Whale first. There she blows!--there she blows!--there she blows!
20080	72	22	There again!--there again!" he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic
20081	70	21	tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible jets.
20082	68	17	"He's going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by
20083	70	18	three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship.
20084	65	17	Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go
20085	70	17	flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by,
20086	72	17	stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!" and he
20087	33	9	slid through the air to the deck.
20088	0	0	
20089	71	19	"He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away from
20090	35	10	us; cannot have seen the ship yet."
20091	0	0	
20092	66	14	"Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!--brace up!
20093	55	13	Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that! Boats, boats!"
20094	0	0	
20095	66	19	Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails
20096	65	15	set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
20097	65	21	leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
20098	58	20	Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

20100	71	21	Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
20101	71	21	but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
20102	67	22	still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
20103	72	22	noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came
20104	70	19	so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump
20105	70	21	was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,
20106	67	20	and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish
20107	72	19	foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head
20108	66	19	beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went
20109	69	21	the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical
20110	70	19	rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters
20111	70	22	interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;
20112	67	19	and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But
20113	72	20	these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly
20114	67	21	feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to
20115	71	19	some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but
20116	71	21	shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back;
20117	66	20	and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and
20118	69	19	to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and
20119	67	20	rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.
20120	0	0	
20121	71	21	A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
20122	64	18	the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
20123	67	21	ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
20124	69	21	eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,
20125	68	19	rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that
20126	69	22	great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so
20127	14	4	divinely swam.
20128	0	0	
20129	66	19	On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once
20130	69	21	leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale
20131	71	21	shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
20132	69	19	namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
20133	68	23	to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
20134	70	20	tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
20135	68	20	who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
20136	48	15	thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
20137	0	0	
20138	70	23	And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
20139	68	20	waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby
20140	67	16	Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
20141	69	20	submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
20142	72	20	But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant
20143	69	22	his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural
20144	64	18	Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the
20145	70	20	grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly
20146	72	19	halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered
20147	36	12	over the agitated pool that he left.
20148	0	0	
20149	72	21	With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the
20150	66	21	three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.
20151	0	0	
20152	71	21	"An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed
20153	69	21	beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
20154	71	24	vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
20155	72	21	whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now
20156	34	10	freshened; the sea began to swell.
20157	0	0	
20158	40	9	"The birds!--the birds!" cried Tashtego.
20159	0	0	
20160	67	20	In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were
20161	69	18	now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began
20162	71	22	fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
20163	72	23	expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab could discover
20164	68	20	no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its
20165	68	19	depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
20166	68	21	weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose,
20167	69	21	till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked
20168	68	21	rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable
20169	65	16	bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast,
20170	63	17	shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The
20171	67	23	glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble
20172	71	22	tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled
20173	67	21	the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon
20174	65	17	Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
20175	67	19	seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
20176	18	3	stand by to stern.
20177	0	0	
20178	72	21	Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its
20179	65	21	bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet
20180	70	19	under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that
20181	72	23	malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself,
20182	71	23	as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath
20183	9	3	the boat.
20184	0	0	
20185	70	18	Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
20186	67	19	an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of
20187	68	17	a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
20188	71	19	mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
20189	67	21	the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
20190	68	21	pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's
20191	68	21	head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale
20192	64	18	now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
20193	63	19	unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
20194	67	21	tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the
20195	16	4	uttermost stern.
20196	0	0	
20197	70	21	And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
20198	70	20	whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
20199	69	21	body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
20200	65	19	the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and
20201	68	24	while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
20202	71	23	impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
20203	68	21	this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
20204	69	19	helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized
20205	71	17	the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
20206	70	18	its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
20207	69	19	frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
20208	72	20	enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,
20209	67	21	and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two
20210	72	21	floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew
20211	70	17	at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast
20212	32	9	to the oars to lash them across.
20213	0	0	
20214	71	20	At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
20215	70	21	to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
20216	67	19	movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand
20217	68	22	had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only
20218	72	21	slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over sideways as it
20219	72	20	slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of
20220	69	21	it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.
20221	0	0	
20222	67	16	Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
20223	71	20	distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
20224	71	19	billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;
20225	70	21	so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or more feet
20226	72	20	out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
20227	70	20	dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray
20228	71	20	still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel
20229	67	19	billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to
20230	36	11	overleap its summit with their scud.

20233	72	25	*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation
20234	68	19	(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down
20235	72	24	poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously
20236	70	19	described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
20237	44	13	view whatever objects may be encircling him.

20239	0	0	
20240	71	21	But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
20241	71	20	and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
20242	72	22	wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.
20243	70	21	The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of
20244	67	22	grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's elephants in the book
20245	70	23	of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's
20246	72	21	insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still
20247	68	21	keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless
20248	71	21	Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
20249	72	19	might burst. From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and
20250	72	18	mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
20251	67	20	succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.
20252	65	18	For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so
20253	70	21	planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed
20254	70	21	horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed,
20255	65	16	still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to
20256	69	19	strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of
20257	68	21	the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they
20258	70	22	themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on
20259	71	24	the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old
20260	11	3	man's head.
20261	0	0	
20262	71	20	Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's
20263	70	19	mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
20264	65	19	and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--"Sail on
20265	70	19	the"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and
20266	70	20	whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing
20267	72	22	to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him
20268	5	1	off!"
20269	0	0	
20270	72	21	The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she
20271	71	20	effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam
20272	34	10	off, the boats flew to the rescue.
20273	0	0	
20274	72	20	Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine
20275	70	18	caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily strength did
20276	70	18	crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for a time, lying
20277	70	21	all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot
20278	67	19	of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as
20279	33	12	desolate sounds from out ravines.
20280	0	0	
20281	71	20	But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
20282	71	23	abbreviate it. In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes condense
20283	70	21	to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
20284	70	19	through feebler men's whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary
20285	61	19	in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their
20286	71	27	life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
20287	69	23	intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures
20288	52	19	contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.
20289	0	0	
20290	72	21	"The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one
20291	25	7	bended arm--"is it safe?"
20292	0	0	
20293	70	18	"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing it.

20295	37	10	"Lay it before me;--any missing men?"
20296	0	0

20298	10	3	five men."

20300	71	18	"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
20301	72	20	there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands off from me!
20302	70	23	The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again! Set the sail; out oars;
20303	10	2	the helm!"
20304	0	0	
20305	70	21	It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
20306	72	20	up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus
20307	70	21	continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But
20308	71	23	the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale,
20309	66	20	for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a
20310	70	19	velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,
20311	68	22	pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a
20312	69	22	hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an
20313	69	23	unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable
20314	64	20	only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it
20315	67	23	sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of
20316	71	21	overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were
20317	72	21	soon swayed up to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having
20318	67	20	been previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her
20319	68	19	side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it
20320	67	20	with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the
20321	69	20	Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known,
20322	72	22	methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced
20323	70	20	from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone
20324	72	20	down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch
20325	69	21	in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his
20326	71	22	voice was heard.--"Whose is the doubloon now? D'ye see him?" and if the
20327	68	17	reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his
20328	67	19	perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless;
20329	36	9	anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
20330	0	0	
20331	72	21	As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,
20332	69	21	or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
20333	69	20	greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at
20334	70	20	every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon
20335	72	20	the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern.
20336	72	23	At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh
20337	71	22	troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man's face
20338	46	14	there now stole some such added gloom as this.

20340	66	18	Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
20341	70	25	evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
20342	69	20	his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed--"The

20352	68	20	"Omen? omen?--the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to

20354	72	23	give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
20355	68	17	of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and
20356	67	21	ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of

20370	72	18	"Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night. Down royals and top-gallant
20371	71	18	stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he's
20372	68	22	making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her
20373	70	16	full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand
20374	71	20	to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning."--Then advancing
20375	69	20	towards the doubloon in the main-mast--"Men, this gold is mine, for I
20376	70	23	earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead;
20377	68	20	and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall be
20378	71	20	killed, this gold is that man's; and if on that day I shall again raise
20379	67	19	him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away
20380	30	7	now!--the deck is thine, sir!"
20381	0	0	
20382	65	17	And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
20383	66	18	slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
20384	45	14	rousing himself to see how the night wore on.

20391	65	19	At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
20392	0	0	
20393	70	21	"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light
20394	10	3	to spread.
20395	0	0	
20396	19	5	"See nothing, sir."
20397	0	0	
20398	66	18	"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
20399	72	20	for;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her all
20400	53	12	night. But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."
20401	0	0	
20402	72	26	Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
20403	72	20	continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
20404	67	20	by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
20405	68	23	wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence
20406	71	24	acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;
20407	68	20	that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they
20408	72	21	will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both
20409	72	24	the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
20410	70	21	sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
20411	68	21	And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of
20412	67	19	a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires
20413	67	20	shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this
20414	65	18	pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the
20415	66	21	cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright
20416	66	23	the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the
20417	70	19	fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and
20418	70	18	diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night
20419	66	20	obscures the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness
20420	68	22	is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the
20421	69	18	pilot's coast is to him. So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the
20422	66	22	proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
20423	72	22	desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the
20424	69	22	mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in
20425	71	20	its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as
20426	70	18	doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or
20427	71	19	the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour;
20428	70	23	even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that
20429	67	22	other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his
20430	70	20	speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have
20431	70	23	gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of
20432	72	24	latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in
20433	72	20	the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what
20434	68	21	present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that
20435	69	23	assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his
20436	66	21	port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile
20437	37	11	matters touching the chase of whales.
20438	0	0	
20439	60	19	The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
20440	67	19	cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
20441	6	2	field.
20442	0	0	
20443	67	15	"By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but this swift motion of the deck
20444	70	20	creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two
20445	71	22	brave fellows!--Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
20446	72	21	on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
20447	28	8	that leaves no dust behind!"
20448	0	0	
20449	67	15	"There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!" was now the
20450	14	3	mast-head cry.
20451	0	0	
20452	65	18	"Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and
20453	71	21	split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
20454	69	19	trump--blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller
20455	37	11	shuts his watergate upon the stream!"
20456	0	0	
20457	69	18	And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies
20458	70	19	of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
20459	67	21	worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
20460	71	21	have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
20461	70	22	growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
20462	71	23	as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand
20463	67	18	of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of
20464	67	18	the previous day; the rack of the past night's suspense; the fixed,
20465	70	17	unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
20466	70	17	towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
20467	70	21	along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
20468	70	21	vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
20469	54	16	that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.
20470	0	0	
20471	70	18	They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
20472	69	19	though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and maple,
20473	69	20	and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran into each
20474	72	20	other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
20475	70	23	directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of
20476	70	18	the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all
20477	71	25	varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal
20478	53	17	goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
20479	0	0	
20480	68	18	The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
20481	69	19	outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
20482	66	19	hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
20483	70	20	shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
20484	67	18	yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
20485	71	21	their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
20486	43	11	seek out the thing that might destroy them!
20487	0	0	
20488	69	19	"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?" cried Ahab, when, after
20489	70	21	the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
20490	72	21	"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet
20491	31	8	that way, and then disappears."
20492	0	0	
20493	70	23	It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
20494	69	20	other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
20495	69	19	hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
20496	71	19	pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the
20497	69	21	air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
20498	70	19	halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as--much nearer to the ship
20499	70	21	than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead--Moby Dick
20500	71	19	bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
20501	72	22	by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
20502	70	22	Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
20503	71	18	of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,
20504	67	21	the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of
20505	70	22	air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the
20506	69	21	distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged
20507	72	22	waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his
20508	16	6	act of defiance.
20509	0	0	
20510	64	17	"There she breaches! there she breaches!" was the cry, as in his
20511	68	24	immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
20512	67	23	Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
20513	72	19	against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
20514	64	20	the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
20515	69	19	stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
20516	65	20	intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
20517	0	0	
20518	72	19	"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour and
20519	72	20	thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore.
20520	22	4	The boats!--stand by!"
20521	0	0	
20522	67	21	Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
20523	63	16	shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
20524	72	17	halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from
20525	10	2	his perch.
20526	0	0	
20527	72	24	"Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare one,
20528	69	20	rigged the afternoon previous. "Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine--keep
20529	53	15	away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!"
20530	0	0	
20531	70	20	As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
20532	67	18	assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
20533	72	19	three crews. Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them
20534	72	21	he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull straight up to his
20535	70	21	forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such
20536	68	22	a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision.
20537	71	23	But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
20538	68	19	plain as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning
20539	68	22	himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing
20540	69	21	among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling
20541	72	22	battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every
20542	69	23	boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which
20543	69	22	those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling
20544	69	22	like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;
20545	70	18	though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's
20546	56	15	unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
20547	0	0	
20548	69	23	But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
20549	70	20	and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
20550	67	18	lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
20551	69	20	warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
20552	69	22	for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
20553	69	23	tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
20554	71	22	line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again--hoping
20555	72	21	that way to disencumber it of some snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage
20556	35	9	than the embattled teeth of sharks!
20557	0	0	
20558	72	22	Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
20559	68	17	and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
20560	66	18	and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat. Only one
20561	66	21	thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
20562	65	17	within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel; dragged in
20563	68	19	the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice
20564	68	20	sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the intercepted fagot of
20565	67	20	steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White
20566	72	23	Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines;
20567	70	20	by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and
20568	72	19	Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on
20569	71	23	a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
20570	70	22	a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
20571	70	19	the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
20572	22	5	stirred bowl of punch.
20573	0	0	
20574	71	21	While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
20575	66	21	the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
20576	72	20	aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his
20577	72	19	legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily
20578	65	20	singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man's
20579	66	20	line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
20580	66	22	rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
20581	69	20	concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
20582	68	22	Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
20583	67	22	from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its
20584	70	20	bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
20585	71	21	again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men struggled out from under
20586	36	13	it, like seals from a sea-side cave.
20587	0	0	
20588	68	21	The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as
20589	71	22	he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
20590	69	20	distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
20591	71	19	back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
20592	68	20	side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
20593	71	18	or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
20594	70	22	came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work
20595	66	21	for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
20596	67	22	ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
20597	43	14	leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.
20598	0	0	
20599	68	22	As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
20600	67	21	came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
20601	72	22	floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and
20602	69	18	safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and
20603	68	21	ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable
20604	69	22	intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;
20605	68	25	but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As
20606	70	20	with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to
20607	70	21	his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor
20608	51	16	did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.
20609	0	0	
20610	71	21	But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
20611	70	19	instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
20612	69	19	Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
20613	63	17	leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
20614	0	0	
20615	71	23	"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
20616	57	17	will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."
20617	0	0	
20618	71	20	"The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up; "I
20619	29	8	put good work into that leg."
20620	0	0	
20621	65	18	"But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.
20622	0	0	
20623	71	20	"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even with
20624	69	24	a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of
20625	70	21	mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost. Nor white whale,
20626	71	20	nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and
20627	68	21	inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
20628	38	10	yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?"
20629	0	0	
20630	23	7	"Dead to leeward, sir."
20631	0	0	
20632	70	20	"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of
20633	70	18	the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat's
20634	7	1	crews."
20635	0	0	
20636	51	12	"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."
20637	0	0	
20638	68	18	"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
20639	66	23	unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!"
20640	0	0	
20641	6	1	"Sir?"
20642	0	0	
20643	66	18	"My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane--there, that
20644	71	21	shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
20645	57	14	By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."
20646	0	0	
20647	70	19	The old man's hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
20648	21	7	Parsee was not there.
20649	0	0	
20650	58	16	"The Parsee!" cried Stubb--"he must have been caught in--"
20651	0	0	
20652	64	18	"The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
20653	42	12	forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"
20654	0	0	
20655	69	19	But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
20656	20	7	nowhere to be found.
20657	0	0	
20658	65	19	"Aye, sir," said Stubb--"caught among the tangles of your line--I
20659	34	9	thought I saw him dragging under."
20660	0	0	
20661	66	16	"MY line! MY line? Gone?--gone? What means that little word?--What
20662	71	19	death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
20663	72	21	The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d'ye see it?--the forged
20664	72	19	iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--blistered fool! this hand did
20665	70	19	dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there! Keep him nailed--Quick!--all
20666	65	19	hands to the rigging of the boats--collect the oars--harpooneers!
20667	65	18	the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a pull on all the
20668	72	20	sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life! I'll ten times girdle
20669	69	21	the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I'll slay
20670	8	2	him yet!
20671	0	0	
20672	69	17	"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself," cried Starbuck;
20673	71	22	"never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In Jesus' name no more of
20674	69	17	this, that's worse than devil's madness. Two days chased; twice stove
20675	71	18	to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
20676	58	16	shadow gone--all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:--
20677	0	0	
20678	72	21	"What more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish
20679	69	16	till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom
20680	63	17	of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh,
20681	45	12	oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!"
20682	0	0	
20683	69	20	"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
20684	71	20	hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes. But in this
20685	71	19	matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
20686	67	20	hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
20687	71	22	whole act's immutably decreed. 'Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
20688	71	25	years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates' lieutenant; I act
20689	72	22	under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.--Stand round
20690	71	21	me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
20691	67	18	lance; propped up on a lonely foot. 'Tis Ahab--his body's part; but
20692	65	21	Ahab's soul's a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
20693	72	21	strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale;
20694	72	22	and I may look so. But ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear
20695	71	20	THAT, know that Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in
20696	71	20	the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they
20697	71	20	drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again,
20698	72	20	to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--tomorrow
20699	69	19	will be the third. Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to spout
20700	38	10	his last! D'ye feel brave men, brave?"
20701	0	0	
20702	32	9	"As fearless fire," cried Stubb.
20703	0	0	
20704	68	19	"And as mechanical," muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
20705	70	20	muttered on: "The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same
20706	70	20	to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
20707	68	19	to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine!--The
20708	72	22	Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go before:--but still was
20709	70	22	to be seen again ere I could perish--How's that?--There's a riddle now
20710	67	17	might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line
20711	70	18	of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain. I'LL, I'LL solve it,
20712	8	2	though!"
20713	0	0	
20714	61	16	When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
20715	0	0	
20716	68	21	So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as
20717	69	19	on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
20718	72	19	grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
20719	69	21	in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
20720	67	21	their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of
20721	71	20	Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as
20722	70	21	on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his
20723	72	24	hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
20724	30	10	eastward for the earliest sun.

20728	35	7	CHAPTER 135. The Chase.--Third Day.
20729	0	0	
20730	0	0	
20731	69	19	The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
20732	70	20	solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
20733	64	18	daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
20734	0	0	
20735	63	17	"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
20736	0	0	
20737	71	19	"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all. Helm
20738	68	20	there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
20739	67	23	again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
20740	66	17	angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
20741	71	20	fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here's food for thought, had
20742	71	20	Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
20743	72	19	THAT'S tingling enough for mortal man! to think's audacity. God only has
20744	71	21	that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a
20745	70	22	calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much
20746	72	19	for that. And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen
20747	66	15	calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents
20748	70	19	turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this
20749	67	18	moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that sort
20750	69	18	of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of
20751	72	21	Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip
20752	71	19	it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they
20753	69	19	cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison
20754	69	18	corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and
20755	67	21	now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!--it's
20756	70	22	tainted. Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable
20757	70	19	world. I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, 'tis a
20758	71	21	noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight
20759	70	19	it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run
20760	72	18	through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not
20761	69	22	stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler
20762	70	16	thing than THAT. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things
20763	65	21	that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are
20764	69	19	bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There's a most
20765	68	22	special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I
20766	68	21	say again, and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and
20767	67	19	gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the
20768	65	19	clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous
20769	69	19	mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of
20770	72	20	the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift
20771	67	21	and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal
20772	69	19	Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these
20773	70	21	Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full as
20774	70	19	strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d'ye see?"
20775	0	0	
20776	15	3	"Nothing, sir."
20777	0	0	
20778	69	21	"Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
20779	70	22	Aye, aye, it must be so. I've oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,
20780	72	18	he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that's bad; I might have known it, too.
20781	70	21	Fool! the lines--the harpoons he's towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by
20782	68	21	last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
20783	22	6	outs! Man the braces!"
20784	0	0	
20785	68	21	Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's
20786	71	23	quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
20787	70	22	ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
20788	11	4	white wake.
20789	0	0	
20790	71	20	"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck to
20791	72	24	himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. "God keep
20792	72	20	us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my
20793	59	17	flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!"
20794	0	0	
20795	69	18	"Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
20796	26	8	"We should meet him soon."
20797	0	0	
20798	70	19	"Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and once
20799	24	7	more Ahab swung on high.
20800	0	0	
20801	70	23	A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
20802	71	20	long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
20803	72	22	weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three
20804	69	22	mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced
20805	3	1	it.
20806	0	0	
20807	70	22	"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
20808	65	18	there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye. He's too
20809	68	17	far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that
20810	71	18	helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
20811	67	24	let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there's
20812	68	19	time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
20813	70	18	not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
20814	67	20	Nantucket! The same!--the same!--the same to Noah as to me. There's
20815	65	19	a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead
20816	66	19	somewhere--to something else than common land, more palmy than the
20817	64	18	palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward,
20818	69	20	then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old
20819	72	18	mast-head! What's this?--green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.
20820	71	22	No such green weather stains on Ahab's head! There's the difference now
20821	71	19	between man's old age and matter's. But aye, old mast, we both grow old
20822	69	20	together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus
20823	69	19	a leg, that's all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
20824	72	20	flesh every way. I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made
20825	70	22	of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of
20826	68	18	vital fathers. What's that he said? he should still go before me, my
20827	67	22	pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the
20828	68	20	bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all
20829	68	21	night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye,
20830	72	21	like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee;
20831	70	19	but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head--keep a good
20832	66	19	eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone. We'll talk to-morrow, nay,
20833	71	20	to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail."
20834	0	0	
20835	66	19	He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
20836	40	12	through the cloven blue air to the deck.
20837	0	0	
20838	68	21	In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop's
20839	71	21	stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
20840	68	21	mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him pause.
20841	0	0	
20842	11	2	"Starbuck!"

20844	6	1	"Sir?"

20848	33	10	"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."

20854	0	0	
20855	65	21	"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of
20856	69	20	the flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb,
20857	47	11	Starbuck. I am old;--shake hands with me, man."
20858	0	0	
20859	64	18	Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.

20861	71	19	"Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's a
20862	66	20	brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!"
20863	0	0	
20864	69	17	"Lower away!"--cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him. "Stand by
20865	10	2	the crew!"
20866	0	0	
20867	63	18	In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
20868	0	0	
20869	72	19	"The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;
20870	33	8	"O master, my master, come back!"
20871	0	0	
20872	71	20	But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
20873	15	6	boat leaped on.
20874	0	0	
20875	70	20	Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
20876	68	19	numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
20877	72	22	the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
20878	68	21	dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their
20879	67	20	bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in
20880	69	19	those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in
20881	71	21	the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching
20882	68	19	regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been
20883	69	21	observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried;
20884	62	17	and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow
20885	69	21	barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the
20886	70	19	sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect them,--however it was,
20887	65	21	they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.
20888	0	0	
20889	69	20	"Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
20890	70	19	following with his eyes the receding boat--"canst thou yet ring boldly
20891	72	18	to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by
20892	70	19	them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?--For
20893	72	25	when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure
20894	72	19	the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening
20895	68	15	and the end of that thing--be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what
20896	65	18	is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
20897	72	21	expectant,--fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,
20898	70	20	as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
20899	65	20	Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to
20900	69	20	see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
20901	71	19	clearing; but clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming? My legs
20902	70	21	feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,--beats
20903	58	14	it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move!
20904	58	17	speak aloud!--Mast-head there! See ye my boy's hand on the
20905	68	19	hill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--
20906	0	0	
20907	73	19	"Mark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he pecks--he
20908	72	19	tears the vane"--pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck--"Ha!
20909	72	19	he soars away with it!--Where's the old man now? see'st thou that sight,
20910	28	7	oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"
20911	0	0	
20912	72	19	The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads--a
20913	63	18	downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but
20914	72	21	intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little
20915	72	22	sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest
20916	65	22	silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the
20917	13	4	opposing bow.
20918	0	0	
20919	66	21	"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
20920	72	21	drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no
20921	56	15	hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!"
20922	0	0	
20923	69	18	Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
20924	65	20	quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
20925	69	20	ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
20926	70	20	subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
20927	70	19	trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
20928	72	23	but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
20929	70	21	hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back
20930	66	18	into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
20931	69	21	an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
20932	68	21	flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
20933	26	7	marble trunk of the whale.
20934	0	0	
20935	70	21	"Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
20936	68	18	the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in
20937	70	18	him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
20938	69	22	from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
20939	70	22	white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
20940	68	22	as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
20941	66	19	flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two
20942	70	21	mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
20943	41	13	but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.
20944	0	0	
20945	71	23	While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
20946	71	21	whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
20947	68	18	shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round
20948	72	19	and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
20949	72	22	during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
20950	72	22	around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
20951	63	18	frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.

20955	69	23	"Befooled, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee! I
20956	71	23	see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is the
20957	69	21	hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of
20958	69	19	thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those
20959	67	22	boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to
20960	70	19	me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first thing that but
20961	70	20	offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
20962	68	16	not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.--Where's the
20963	24	8	whale? gone down again?"
20964	0	0	
20965	70	22	But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
20966	72	23	corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
20967	72	24	been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily
20968	69	16	swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,--which thus far had
20969	69	21	been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present
20970	64	19	her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost
20971	72	20	velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the
20972	4	2	sea.
20973	0	0	
20974	68	19	"Oh! Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third
20975	69	20	day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that
20976	19	5	madly seekest him!"
20977	0	0	
20978	72	20	Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
20979	67	18	leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding
20980	70	20	by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he
20981	72	24	leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow
20982	67	20	him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he
20983	65	23	saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
20984	66	20	mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
20985	71	21	which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
20986	72	21	repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped,
20987	69	17	he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves
20988	72	20	on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he
20989	71	21	heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving
20990	71	22	a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or
20991	70	21	flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had
20992	71	21	just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer
20993	38	11	and nails, and so nail it to the mast.
20994	0	0	
20995	67	18	Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance
20996	69	20	to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
20997	69	22	latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
20998	70	22	Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
20999	72	22	nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start had not been
21000	68	22	so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the
21001	68	21	unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the
21002	71	21	boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became
21003	67	17	jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost
21004	10	3	every dip.
21005	0	0	
21006	72	21	"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on!
21007	63	15	'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water."
21008	0	0	
21009	67	17	"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"
21010	0	0	
21011	60	14	"They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell"--he
21012	64	18	muttered--"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
21013	72	21	Ahab?--But pull on! Aye, all alive, now--we near him. The helm! take the
21014	72	19	helm! let me pass,"--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
21015	37	9	to the bows of the still flying boat.
21016	0	0	
21017	66	18	At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
21018	66	20	with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
21019	68	21	advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the
21020	69	17	smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled
21021	69	19	round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
21022	66	16	with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
21023	68	23	poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
21024	69	20	hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
21025	72	20	into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh
21026	69	20	flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly
21027	71	22	canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the
21028	69	22	gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed
21029	67	21	into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen--who foreknew not the
21030	66	21	precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its
21031	70	19	effects--these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of
21032	69	21	them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing
21033	70	20	wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly
21034	47	12	dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.
21035	0	0	
21036	61	21	Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
21037	69	21	instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
21038	68	21	sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
21039	71	20	the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
21040	71	22	seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
21041	61	17	felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
21042	0	0	
21043	69	20	"What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again; oars! oars!
21044	19	5	Burst in upon him!"
21045	0	0	
21046	71	23	Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
21047	66	21	round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
21048	70	19	catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
21049	69	22	in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it--it may be--a
21050	67	21	larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
21051	50	14	prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
21052	0	0	
21053	66	18	Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. "I grow blind; hands!
21054	63	16	stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is't night?"
21055	0	0	
21056	50	13	"The whale! The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.
21057	0	0	
21058	69	19	"Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
21059	72	23	ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see:
21060	63	13	the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?"
21061	0	0	
21062	58	18	But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
21063	70	20	sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
21064	70	20	burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
21065	72	17	lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying
21066	52	16	hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
21067	0	0	
21068	69	21	Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer
21069	70	19	remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
21070	68	19	with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
21071	66	17	forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
21072	70	19	bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
21073	6	2	as he.
21074	0	0	
21075	72	20	"The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,
21076	68	20	now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman's
21077	69	18	fainting fit. Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the
21078	70	19	end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab,
21079	70	17	Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again!
21080	69	22	He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one,
21081	64	14	whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!"
21082	0	0	
21083	72	19	"Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help
21084	72	19	Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
21085	69	18	Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb's own unwinking
21086	67	21	eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too
21087	64	19	soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou
21088	69	19	grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of
21089	72	22	as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet
21090	69	18	ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou
21091	66	15	grinning whale, but there'll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
21092	65	19	not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in
21093	68	19	his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;--cherries!
21094	62	18	cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!"
21095	0	0	
21096	70	19	"Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
21097	69	16	my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
21098	39	12	now come to her, for the voyage is up."
21099	0	0	
21100	71	19	From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
21101	67	20	bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
21102	72	20	hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all their
21103	71	21	enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely
21104	69	22	vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading
21105	72	25	semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance,
21106	69	22	eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal
21107	71	21	man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's
21108	69	20	starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their
21109	70	22	faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook
21110	67	18	on their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters
21111	40	13	pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.
21112	0	0	
21113	69	20	"The ship! The hearse!--the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the boat;
21114	34	11	"its wood could only be American!"
21115	0	0	
21116	67	20	Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
21117	69	20	keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
21118	70	20	off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for a
21119	23	8	time, he lay quiescent.
21120	0	0	
21121	72	17	"I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer.
21122	72	23	Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only
21123	68	19	god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed
21124	69	20	prow,--death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I
21125	69	19	cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh,
21126	72	22	lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in
21127	72	19	my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in,
21128	72	22	ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and top this one piled comber
21129	70	21	of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering
21130	67	18	whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at
21131	69	19	thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins
21132	70	23	and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let
21133	69	21	me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee,
21134	46	14	thou damned whale! THUS, I give up the spear!"
21135	0	0	
21136	70	19	The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
21137	69	22	velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul. Ahab stooped to
21138	67	18	clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
21139	69	19	neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
21140	70	20	shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
21141	68	20	heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty
21142	69	21	tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
21143	7	1	depths.
21144	0	0	
21145	70	17	For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned. "The
21146	71	19	ship? Great God, where is the ship?" Soon they through dim, bewildering
21147	72	24	mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana;
21148	69	22	only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or
21149	69	22	fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers
21150	71	23	still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric
21151	72	22	circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating
21152	67	23	oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all
21153	70	22	round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod
21154	13	4	out of sight.
21155	0	0	
21156	66	19	But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
21157	70	23	sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
21158	71	19	erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
21159	70	21	which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
21160	69	19	billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
21161	66	21	hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing
21162	69	17	the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
21163	70	20	tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
21164	69	19	among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
21165	72	20	this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the
21166	69	22	hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill,
21167	71	21	the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen
21168	67	19	there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his
21169	70	21	imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the
21170	72	18	flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink
21171	72	20	to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
21172	25	7	helmeted herself with it.

21174	72	19	Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
21175	68	20	surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great
21176	65	22	shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.

21186	22	6	did survive the wreck.
21187	0	0	
21188	71	22	It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom the
21189	69	21	Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman, when that bowsman
21190	70	19	assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
21191	69	20	men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
21192	69	20	floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
21193	67	18	when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then,
21194	71	18	but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
21195	70	21	subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
21196	72	20	towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling
21197	66	22	circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital
21198	70	19	centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of
21199	71	19	its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great
21200	72	21	force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and
21201	70	20	floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day
21202	72	21	and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks,
21203	72	20	they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks
21204	72	23	sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer,
21205	69	21	and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in
21206	67	19	her retracing search after her missing children, only found another
21207	7	2	orphan.
